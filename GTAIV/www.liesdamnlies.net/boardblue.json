Listen, I know it sounds crazy, but I was tagged with a human-implantable tracking device as a baby in the 1970s. My brothers had natural births at home but I was delivered in the hospital. Whilst they both have high-flying careers and beautiful families, my life has been defined by a spiral of drug abuse and manic depression. All my friends turned on me in high school and since then I have been sacked repeatedly from dead-end jobs and dumped by every ugly girl who was medicated enough to sleep with me. Everyone I meet tries to fuck with my head. I have the sensation of being followed constantly and every time I take a crap I feel like there is someone watching FROM INSIDE THE BOWL. I thought that I had finally rid myself of the evil spychip when I cut off my left hand a couple of years ago but the mind games have got worse. Can anyone help? Was this not prophesied in the Bible? Whose laughing now? Not ME!!!",
