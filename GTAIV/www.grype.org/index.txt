0x58B742E0=极客赢了！

;0x42D25DA8=Internet 1.5, 2.0 and 3.75 are taking America's largest billion dollar companies and throwing them in the toilet. For years and years, misinformed consumers were duped into paying through the nose for television, music and phone calls. NOW IT IS FREE. THIS IS THE FUTURE! Everything will be free, people who create things will be forced to give them away for free, but they will be famous, and everything will be about trying to sell you something else. That is important. We spit on phone companies, musicians, movie writers and anyone creative who has made a fortune out of fleecing their fans by charging for what people want. It's free, as long as we sell you another thing at the same time.          
0x42D25DA8=历代互联网的发展过程，简直就是市值上亿的大公司把钱砸到屎坑里。多年以来，广大消费者被误导着为电视节目、音乐和电话付费。现在，这些都「免费」了。这就是「未来」！一切东西都会变成免费，创作者被要求免费提供他们的作品，但他们会名气大增；接着各种商品也会找上门来向你推销。这一点是很重要的。我们鄙视通信运营商、音乐家、电影编剧，还有那些创作者，他们以这种形式骗客户和粉丝，让他们付钱，借此来发财。只要我们还卖给你别的东西的同时，以上东西都是免费的。

;0x0D9C749D=With phone companies, it was a license to print money.  It was the never-ending honeymoon. Then, the Internet came along and gate-crashed the party. Grype allows you to call people over the Internet for free (so long as they have Grype!) and is completely untraceable.  Perfect for every kind of criminal activity! Call strangers!
0x0D9C749D=通信运营商一本万利，发财之路似乎永无止境。但是，互联网出现了，打破了这一切。使用Grype，你可以通过互联网免费打电话（对方也需使用Grype），并且通话是完全隐私的，很适合干坏事！现在就给陌生人打个电话吧！

;0xB6BB0253=Grype is so much more than a phone network; it is a community. Grype brings people together who never cared about each other and never will.  You can chat with random strangers about similar interests and perversions. You can lie about your age and stalk young girls.  You can play pranks on unwitting victims or talk them into giving you their credit card number. You can have phone sex with weirdos from every corner of the globe or use the conference feature to get involved in a full-blown cyber-orgy, and nobody will comment on your spotty back. It is the danger that makes Grype exciting. 
0xB6BB0253=不止是网络电话，Grype更是一个社交平台。Grype把现在和以后可能不会有交集的人聚在了一起。在这里，你可以和陌生人聊聊相同的兴趣和癖好；可以谎报年龄，窥屏美女；可以拿当事人找乐子，或者骗他们的钱；可以和全球的贵物玩文爱，甚至开电话会议搞淫趴。在线上，没有人在意你的长相如何。来Grype，就是寻刺激的。

;0x0756274A=Will the connection cut out?  Will a 4-year-old hack into your call? Will that person you just added to your buddy list turn out to be a serial killer or a scam artist asking for money to fund his dying grandmother's operation? You can't put a price on communication, so we don't.  We believe in freedom: the freedom to pronounce Grype and VoIP however you like; the freedom to throw on a headset, never be able to move around the house when talking to someone, and most of all, stick it to your phone company so that when your internet connection goes down, your telephone, email, TV, everything - goes dark! 
0x0756274A=Grype会炸服吗？Grype是不是很容易被黑客攻击？刚加的好友会不会反转成连环杀手，或者是借口求大家捐款给他家人动手术的大骗子？你无法用价格来衡量人与人之间沟通的价值，我们也是。我们认为自由是这样的：Grype和VoIP这两个词，你想怎么念就怎么念；你也可以耳机一戴，电话打上一天。最重要的是，我们家的产品你爱用不用。继续去给运营商送钱吧，只要网一断，你的电话、邮件、电视，你的一切，全部都没了！

;0xAEFE8298=Once all your friends have converted to the same computer set-up and installed the software, you are ready to start pre-planning all your phone calls to ensure that both parties are in front of their PCs at a specific time with Grype running.  Sound convenient?  It's the future!  Get with the fidelity that sounds like you are talking on a 1949 Russian military field radio.  Enjoy hearing your friends sound like robots when the bandwidth gets strained.  It's a crazy revolution, and sometimes the communication sounds like someone shit into a tin can phone. We laugh at the billions of dollars that traditional phone carriers have invested in their networks.  The old telephone model is dead.  Join the Grype revolution.
0xAEFE8298=等你的朋友配好硬件，装好软件，你们就可以约好时间一起上线，坐在电脑面前狂欢了。是不是很方便？这就是未来！在Grype，你可以体验一把冷战苏军通讯兵的感觉，也可以体验到网络卡顿的时候朋友的全损音质。虽然有时候它像纸杯电话一样脆弱，但这是一项全新的技术。通信运营商们为他们手头上的那些破玩意投资了几十亿美元，真是太好笑了。传统的电话已经成为历史了，一起加入Grype引领的技术革命吧。
