Everything will be free, people who create things will be forced to give them away for free, but they will be famous, and everything will be about trying to sell you something else. That is important. We spit on phone companies, musicians, movie writers and anyone creative who has made a fortune out of fleecing their fans by charging for what people want. It's free, as long as we sell you another thing at the same time.",

You can have phone sex with weirdos from every corner of the globe or use the conference feature to get involved in a full-blown cyber-orgy, and nobody will comment on your spotty back.
