Chiropractics is a way to bring the suspension harness and sticky leather torture table out of the dungeon and into the hearts and faceless strip malls of every hypochondriac suburb in America.

Well imagine the habit-forming potential of an unexpected but violent crack of the spinal column! The beauty of popping someone's back is that they feel fantastic, temporarily. Our chiropractor starter kit teaches you how to cash in on this rush of endorphins and how to turn the fleeting psychosomatic relief into a lucrative business. Spinal manipulation pays!",

We will show you how to focus on the erogenous zones to create an atmosphere of brief, awkward intimacy that will leave the patient feeling confused and violated yet somehow hungry for more.
