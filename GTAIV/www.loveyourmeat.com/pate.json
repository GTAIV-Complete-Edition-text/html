One day your son is 14 and giving up meat seems like a great way to get laid, the next he's stopped washing, grown dreadlocks, and is hanging out at Now & Zen.  The twitching curtains from the neighbors, the wry smirks from work colleagues, the disgusted sneers from the trashman... it's easy to overlook the devastating impact that vegetarianism can have on the rest of the family.  Thanksgiving, picnics, BBQs, hot dogs at the game... everything you hoped and planned for suddenly lost in the bottom of a wheatgrass shot.",
