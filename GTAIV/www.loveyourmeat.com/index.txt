;0xA686BD28=Animals kill each other, sometimes on TV.  Some say survival of the fittest.  Others say, "Hamsters eat their babies too." However, there's a reason why we don't keep polar bears as pets.  Don't kid yourself - your cat wouldn't think twice about tearing you from limb to limb if it weighed 400 pounds!  We didn't spend millions of years fighting our way up the food chain to live out our days on Tofu turkey roasts and bean casseroles.  Prehistoric man would not have made it very far if he had sat around handing out crudites and spinach dips while organizing marches in protest of the treatment of the saber-toothed tiger.  We kill to survive, like on TV.  We are simply better at killing than animals.  Hate the game, not the player. Only a very stupid species stops doing the thing they are best at, surely?

0xB036C637=

;0x014DFECE=It's very simple:  man needs oxygen, oxygen comes from plants, vegetarians eat plants.  Growing plants for consumption is a very inefficient way of generating food and, pound for pound, far more energy and resources are expended on filling the bellies of soap-shy vegetarians than our carnivorous friends.  Methane is about twenty times stronger than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas and a major cause of global warming.  And we all know that the biggest outputters of methane are cows and vegans. As a result, we want to kill both, before we boil.

;0xB1495479=As a vegetarian, you have two choices:  if you're rich, you buy organic and take your chances with slugs, bugs, worms and E. Coli; if not, you dine on a smorgasbord of pesticides, herbicides and fungicides.  You do not need a PhD in Molecular Biology to work out that something designed in a lab to exterminate insects and rodents is unlikely to carry a lot of health benefits.  Either way, in today's pesticide infested world, you're playing Russian Roulette with your lower digestive tract. Get back on the meat, before you end up on the slab.

;0x92371E3A=Put the slaughterhouse photos away.  They're all doctored in graphics editing software to make the animals frown.  What about the illegal immigrants who toil the fields for a few dollars a day to pick the designer vegetables for your finger buffets and brunch canapes?  Vegetarians saturate the media with images of battery hens and then deny that there is nothing sinister about a combine harvester slashing up fields of genetically-modified, identically-sized baby carrots.  It's just not right.

They can work occasionally, if deep-fried in lard, but they can never replace man's fundamental need to flame-grill his fellow mammals.  Beef, pork, lamb, cat, chicken, penguin... LoveYourMeat.com is a glorious celebration of all the meats that we know and love.

;0x8A2A151F=For every dinner party that's been ruined by an undernourished tree-hugger spouting anecdotes about poultry-processing and veal-fattening while you are trying to suck the last of the marrow from a rack of ribs;  for every man and woman who has known the joy of arising slick-faced from a steaming animal carcass, this is the website for you.  Don't fall for the hype.  Until we feel an instinctive urge to graze in our backyard or chew cud at the weekends, we should embrace the base desire in all of us to rip flesh from the bone at every opportunity.

Is it not laughable to call fungus, seaweed and milk curds stuffed into a plastic sack a sausage?  Or mushroom granola bean curd stamped into bacon strips?  Like a celibate man with a blow-up doll, vegetarians self-righteously shun animal products and then spend their lives trying to simulate them at every meal.
