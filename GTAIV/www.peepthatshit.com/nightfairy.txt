;0x1AE46D5A=Some call it entertainment; others call it performance nonsense.  Either way, kids can't seem to get enough of naked men covered in body paint and glitter.  Through experimental electronica and the medium of mime, Fairy Body Paint teaches us about male bonding and the futility of human existence, especially when 4 male nymphs are interlocking their painted naked bodies to form household furniture.  Your son is never too young to get into musical theater and this show will raise all sorts of important questions.
