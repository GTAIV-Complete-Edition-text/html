;0x19A522C2=Irish pubs are everywhere.  It's amazing that there are any Irish left in Ireland.  First they opened up bars throughout continental Europe so that the British could binge-drink when they went abroad without having to mix with the locals.  Then they started their assault on America.  The Americans love to claim distant Irish relatives from 11 generations ago so that they can get loaded like every day is St. Patrick's Day.  These days you can go to the most remote Amazonian settlement and still find an Irish pub nestled between a Wigwam Burger and Bean Machine Coffee, with a bartender who has a horrible  accent.  Not that it's exactly difficult to open one.  A wooden floor, some green paint, a few olde-world artifacts, a couple of shamrocks, a CD of depressing folk songs about murdering your family, some meaningless words in Gaelic, Blarney's on tap, a stupid name like Stinky O'Muff's and you're in business.  If you want the real deal in Liberty City - a bar where people still punch first and ask questions second - you should check out Lucky Winkle's in Purgatory, a place that seems to have been on the corner of Galveston and Hell Gate since the dawn of time.  Another of our favorites is the historic Steinway Beer Garden in Dukes, the perfect spot to hide from your probation officer for an afternoon.  Get in there, get drunk and get into a fight.  Make the Emerald Isle proud your ancestors left and never came back!     
0x19A522C2=爱尔兰酒馆开得到处都是，这样爱尔兰本土还有爱尔兰人剩下简直是奇迹。他们先是在欧洲大陆开店，让英国人在国外也能喝上酒，不用和当地人混在一起。然后又向美国发动袭击。美国人喜欢自称往上十一代有个爱尔兰亲戚，这样就能每天都像圣帕特里克节一样喝个烂醉了。即便是在最远的印第安人亚马逊河聚居地，你都能在Wigwam汉堡和冰的咖啡之间找到爱尔兰酒馆，店里的酒保还有一口浓厚的口音。开店似乎也没那么难。铺上木头地板，涂上绿漆，放几个仿造古董，种上一些三叶草，播一些关于杀害家人的致郁民谣，用盖尔语随便写几个词，酒桶里装上Blarneys黑啤，起一个Stinky O'Muff's之类的傻逼名字，好了可以开业了。如果你想在自由城找到先动手再动口的正牌爱尔兰酒馆，可以去Purgatory的幸运田螺看看，这家酒馆似乎一直都在Galveston大道和Hell Gate的路口。我们推荐的另一家酒馆是历史悠久的Steinway啤酒园，位于Dukes区。紧急的时候也可以进去躲避缓刑官，过一下午他都找不到你。踏进店门，喝个烂醉，狠狠干上一架吧。让绿宝石岛为你一去不回的祖先而骄傲吧！
