;0x3B00CF76=Spend a day in Liberty City and you will discover that you are a lot more normal than you thought.  People here are nicer than you would expect.   If you get hit by a car or get shot, people will come to your aid, often after checking your pockets.  There is no better place for people watching.  At best, it is an eclectic mix; at worst, a freak show.  The streets are a carnival of the bizarre and there are arguably more lunatics per block than anywhere else in the world.  You will never find more people externalizing their internal dialogue than in Liberty City.  You think you have seen it all and then you round a corner to see a 400lb man dressed as a baby or a naked senior citizen riding a unicycle.  Keep your camera phone at the ready.
