;0x52AD90D5=If you think clowns and furries are creepy, puppeteers take it to a whole new level.  There is something fundamentally wrong, yet exciting, about a grown man talking to kids in a squeaky voice with his hand up the ass of a genderless toy.  Unbelievable special effects, double-jointed actors and an imaginative range of anatomically-absurd glove puppets combine to create a show for the whole family that is both stimulating and disturbing.  Come with an open mind.  Leave with the image of puppet families engaged in fuzzy drug-addled partner swapping burned into your brain forever.
