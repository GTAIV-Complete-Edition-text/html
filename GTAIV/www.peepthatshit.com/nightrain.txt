;0x67799DA5=Critics are calling this one a 'real one eye-opener'.  A new musical by the Liberty City Amateur Dramatic Society, Raincoat Exposé deals with the trials and tribulations of a misunderstood, middle-aged flasher who prowls around parks and schoolyards asking people to look at his junk.  Will the local community ever come to view him as a lonely exhibitionist rather than a sexual predator?  Lots of great songs in this one.
