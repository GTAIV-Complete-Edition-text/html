        "original": "It looks like a delicious burger, it smells like a delicious burger so it must be a delicious burger!  Burger Shot has paid aroma and taste scientists millions to devise that smell and taste that has you coming back for more.  Don't listen to all those scare-mongering documentaries on TV about worm meat, diseased off-cuts and mutant lab cows.   It's just hippy propaganda designed to make you feel guilty about enjoying greasy food and being American.  Burger Shot is the global fast food chain where the burgers just keep on getting bigger.  The new Heartstopper is a 6lb monstrosity of cheese and livestock matter that might just give you a stroke.  What more can you ask for?  How about half off your order if you have actually had a stroke and half your face has gone numb?  Now that's a great deal.",
        "translated": "这汉堡看着香，闻着香，吃起来一定更香！吃得饱汉堡在香料和口味上投入了数百万研究资金，制造出了这种让你念念不忘的香味。别相信电视上骗人的纪录片说的什么肉里有虫、原料染病和变异牛肉。这是那些嬉皮士的阴谋，想让你为吃油炸食品以及身为美国人感到罪恶。吃得饱汉堡是遍布全球的快餐连锁，汉堡尺寸也越来越大。全新推出的心肺停止堡是一个奶酪和肉有六磅重的怪物，甚至有让人中风的风险。还能有什么要求呢？要是你真中风了，半张脸面瘫了，下次再来就直接半价如何？这可太划算了。",
