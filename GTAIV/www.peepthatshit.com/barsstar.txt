;0x9E1F551E=Founded by a handful of annoying Brits who realized Americans love to buy T-shirts for places where they've eaten chicken wings and gotten drunk, the Super Star Café is a famous chain of bar-restaurants that has spread around the world. Wherever there are merchandise-collecting tourists in the world, a Super Star Café will not be too far away.  People love their Super Star t-shirts and wear them like a badge of honor when they get home, convinced that everybody will think that they are living on the edge, partying with the rich and famous.  Liberty City boasts two of these theme restaurants with their swanky interiors, high ceilings, comfy chairs and split-level seating areas.  If you like American comfort food, loud music and video games, expensive, watered-down drinks and being served by an overly-chatty failed actor, you should definitely check out the Super Star Café in Lancaster or The Triangle.  If nothing else, they are great places to pick up drunken Europeans.
