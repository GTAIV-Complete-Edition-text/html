;0x61C99DD6=Ready for some pathos?  Overwhelming pessimism is the order of the day in Abandon Shit, a serious drama that is seriously up its own ass.  Tangled sub-plots, angst-ridden monologues and over-acted dream sequences show us that life is painful, happiness is impossible and death is inevitable and that you will be left to decompose like a pile of abandoned shit.  As the protagonist tells us at the end while tearing out her hair in a pool of menstrual blood, "Before you can love, you have to learn to hate".  Nobody actually enjoys this crap but it impresses people at dinner parties.
