        "original": "If you think clowns and furries are creepy, puppeteers take it to a whole new level.  There is something fundamentally wrong, yet exciting, about a grown man talking to kids in a squeaky voice with his hand up the ass of a genderless toy.  Unbelievable special effects, double-jointed actors and an imaginative range of anatomically-absurd glove puppets combine to create a show for the whole family that is both stimulating and disturbing.  Come with an open mind.  Leave with the image of puppet families engaged in fuzzy drug-addled partner swapping burned into your brain forever.",
        "translated": "如果你觉得小丑和动物皮套很可怕，人偶师一定能把你吓出魂来。大男人手伸到无性玩偶的屁股里，掐着嗓子跟小孩说话，这种事肯定有哪里不对，但还挺让人兴奋的。以假乱真的特效，关节反弯的演员，还有想象力丰富的解剖学上不可能存在的手偶，共同创造了这样一出惊悚刺激的合家欢剧目。带着开放的思想走进剧院，走出剧院时只记得嗑了药的毛绒玩偶在开换妻淫趴。",
