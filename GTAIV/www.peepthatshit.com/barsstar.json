        "original": "Founded by a handful of annoying Brits who realized Americans love to buy T-shirts for places where they've eaten chicken wings and gotten drunk, the Super Star Café is a famous chain of bar-restaurants that has spread around the world. Wherever there are merchandise-collecting tourists in the world, a Super Star Café will not be too far away.  People love their Super Star t-shirts and wear them like a badge of honor when they get home, convinced that everybody will think that they are living on the edge, partying with the rich and famous.  Liberty City boasts two of these theme restaurants with their swanky interiors, high ceilings, comfy chairs and split-level seating areas.  If you like American comfort food, loud music and video games, expensive, watered-down drinks and being served by an overly-chatty failed actor, you should definitely check out the Super Star Café in Lancaster or The Triangle.  If nothing else, they are great places to pick up drunken Europeans.",
        "translated": "一小撮烦人的英国人发现，美国人喜欢在刚才吃了鸡翅喝了啤酒的店里购买纪念短袖，于是他们建立了Super Star Café，现在已是连锁店遍布世界各地的酒吧餐馆。只要有喜欢收集周边产品的观光客在，附近一定会有一家Super Star Café。人们喜欢在各地购买Super Star短袖，穿在身上回家就像是戴上了纪念章。他们还觉得这身衣服是潮的象征，能让别人以为自己天天和富人名人开派对。自由城以有两家Super Star Café为自豪，内部装修豪华，天花板高，椅子舒服，二楼还有卡座。如果你喜欢美式甜点、大声的音乐和电子游戏，还有昂贵的掺水饮品，以及由落魄演员担当的碎嘴服务员，务必去他们在Lancaster或Triangle的连锁店看看。更何况那里还很适合勾搭喝醉的欧洲人。",
