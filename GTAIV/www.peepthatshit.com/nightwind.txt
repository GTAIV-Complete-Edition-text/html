;0xAD8D30C6=You can't see wind, but you can feel it, especially in this show that takes wind to a whole new level.  Feel the interactive vibe of a theater performance where the cast cuts wind in the face of the audience. The Wind From Below reminds us that comedy does not have to be subtle or clever or funny.  Sometimes a bald man getting a real ripper unleashed on his face is all you need. The acoustics at the Maginot Theater are perfect for a show that is about cutting loose and having a good-ass time.  Until you've seen 100 people honking their butt trumpets in unison at strangers, you haven't experienced entertainment.  It's a blast!
