        "original": "Ready for some pathos?  Overwhelming pessimism is the order of the day in Abandon Shit, a serious drama that is seriously up its own ass.  Tangled sub-plots, angst-ridden monologues and over-acted dream sequences show us that life is painful, happiness is impossible and death is inevitable and that you will be left to decompose like a pile of abandoned shit.  As the protagonist tells us at the end while tearing out her hair in a pool of menstrual blood, \"Before you can love, you have to learn to hate\".  Nobody actually enjoys this crap but it impresses people at dinner parties.",
        "translated": "想来点悲情共振吗？《野屎》是一部非常把自己当回事的正剧，排山倒海的悲观情绪就是它的主要内容。情节错综复杂，独白充满焦虑，梦境部分表演夸张。本剧告诉我们，人生是痛苦的，幸福是无望的，死亡是必然的，你的结局就是像坨野屎一样暴尸野外自然分解。正如结局部分主人公在月经的血泊中绝望的呐喊「爱一个人，首先要学会恨」。",
