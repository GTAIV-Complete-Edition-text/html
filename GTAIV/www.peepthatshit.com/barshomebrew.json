        "original": "A good bar should feel like home: warm and damp like a communal bathtub.   And the Homebrew Café is like home - familiar, but lonely and full of angry people you have to pretend to like in order to avoid a fight.  If you don't mind your beer served slowly and with some serious attitude, Broker's Homebrew Café will transport you straight from Liberty City to the heart of Jamaica.  Much of the beer is made in a real home bathtub.  Anyone who finds a pubic hair in their lager gets a free shot.   Don't expect 5-star treatment at this no-frills hangout in Beechwood City, but it is definitely a fun place to get fucked up, play some pool, chase a chubby, drink some Pride Brew and eat some curried goat.  Enjoy.",
        "translated": "好的酒吧就该有家一样的感觉，像公共澡堂一样温暖潮湿。而家庭咖啡馆正能给你家的感觉：熟悉但又孤独，必须对几个讨厌的暴脾气强颜欢笑，才能不引起纠纷。如果你不介意上酒的速度和严肃的服务态度，位于Broker的家庭咖啡馆能让你从自由城直达牙买加。店里的啤酒真的是在家里的浴缸酿的，酒里吃出阴毛就可以免单。别想着在Beechwood City的这家平民店得到五星级招待，但这绝对是一个好去处。可以喝个烂醉，打会儿台球，追追胖子，喝点啤酒，吃点咖喱羊肉。尽情享受吧。",
