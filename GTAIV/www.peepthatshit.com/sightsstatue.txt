;0x066AFCE2=The Statue of Happiness is perhaps the definitive symbol of the American dream, even though it was a gift from the French.  Lady Happiness was presented to the USA by France in 1886 as a symbol of joy to mark 100 years of being free from British food and spelling.  Take a boat out to Happiness Island to see the statue close up, look up her skirt, and imagine how warm it must be in freedom's vagina.
