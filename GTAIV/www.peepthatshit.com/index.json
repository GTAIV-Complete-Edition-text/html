A city needs energy and a split personality... and Liberty City has both in abundance. Grit and glitz; edge and elegance; alliteration and agony - this is a city of contrasts where culture and diversity rub shoulders with crime and excess and stick their tongues down each other's throats in a drunken frenzy.",
