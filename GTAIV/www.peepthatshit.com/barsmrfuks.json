        "original": "Are you ready to do some Seoul searching? Known for its exotic ingredients, tyrannical owner and mystery meat surprises, Mr. Fuk's Rice Box is a bustling, cavernous restaurant on two floors in Alderney City's vibrant Korean area. When we say 'vibrant', we mean overcrowded, infested shit heap. Our best advice for an enjoyable meal at Mr. Fuk's is not to ask too many questions and don't look into the kitchen, you won't like what you see. Roasted intestines, pig feet, coagulated ox blood, live octopus... these are people on the edge who will eat anything if you tell them that it is an aphrodisiac. Just watch out for those squirming tentacles on the way down - the Heimlich maneuver isn't going to do shit if you get a sucker clamped to your esophagus. Please bear in mind that kimchi is to Koreans as fries are to Americans - they have it with EVERY meal. If fermented, florescent cabbage is your thing, give Mr. Fuk's Rice Box a try. Korean barbeques introduced the West to a whole new concept: paying to cook your own food! You'll feel very full, slightly ill and then starving hungry again - all within a 20-minute period. Well worth a visit.",
        "translated": "想来一次首尔探险吗？闻名于异域食材、暴君老板和神秘的肉源，老曹盒饭是一家繁忙空敞的饭店，开在Alderney市充满生机的朝鲜人聚集地的两层小楼里。「充满生机」的意思是人头攒动、过于恶心。想要在老曹这儿美美地吃上一餐，我们的建议是别问服务员太多问题，更不要往厨房里看，知道具体情况你就要后悔了。烤大肠、猪蹄、牛血块、章鱼刺身... 只要告诉他们能壮阳，这些暴躁的家伙什么都敢吃。吞下那些蠕动的触手时要小心，海姆利希急救法对紧紧吸住你的食道的东西不起作用。记住这一点：泡菜之于朝鲜人就像是薯条之于美国人，每顿饭都要吃的。如果发酵的白菜叶子是你的菜，就去老曹盒饭试试吧。朝鲜烤肉给西方带来了全新的理念：花了钱还要自己做菜！你会在20分钟内体验从吃饱了到不舒服再到饿死了的全过程。值得一去。",
