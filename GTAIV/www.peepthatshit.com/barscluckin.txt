;0x65E4247E=Cluckin' Bell has the best TV commercials ever.  Have you seen them?  And what great food.  They are always careful to keep the secret ingredient of their tasty batter - salt - under wraps.  It is amazing how they managed to take one of the world's healthiest meats and turn it into a lethal death trap.  Forget avian flu - Cluckin Bell's deep-fried carrion has been killing people for decades.  A visit to Cluckin' Bell leaves a thin film of grease and dirt all over your body that takes days to wash off... and that's why we love it.  Stop off for a Mighty Cluck.  Only 99c!  That's cheaper than water!   Or try the Stuffed Pollo Todo Frito.  It's an entire chicken stuffed with mashed potatoes and gravy then deep fried!  Awesome.
