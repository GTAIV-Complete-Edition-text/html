;0x3DEA3A9F=This play introduces us to a young Shakespeare who is crippled with writer's block and eats a facefull of LSD to counteract it.  He is about to stab himself in the heart when the Queen arrives dressed as a commoner, rips the knife from his hand, makes a speech with cryptic sexual allusions that must have been witty 400 years ago but make no sense now, throws it into the fire and then teaches him how to smoke hash through a wine bottle.  Gradually, we witness Shakespeare's creative awakening through mind-expanding narcotics as he begins working late into the night, playing a lute, filling pages with paranoid ramblings about ghosts, floating daggers, witches and elves while munching incessantly on chocolate and candy.
