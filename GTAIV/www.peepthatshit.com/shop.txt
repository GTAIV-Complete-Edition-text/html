;0x8300B293=Liberty City is the fashion capital of the United States.  Why? Because it's the home of stupid money and people who can spend $18,000 on cufflinks.  But there are clothing stores to suit every budget.  Nothing screams that you've made it quite like a designer label, and a visit to Perseus in Middle Park East will have you looking like a player in no time.  If Didier Sachs and Gutter & Blood are not your thing, shops down at Hove Beach in Broker can kit you out in itchy polyester for less than the cost of a round of drinks.

Where else can you spot stores that have had a 'going out of business' sale for the last 15 years?  Where else can you see so many 24-hour delis with 24 year-old cold cuts?  Most of the tourists head straight for the Spenders department store in The Triangle but there are lots of other places where you can engage in a bit of retail therapy:
