        "original": "Cluckin' Bell has the best TV commercials ever.  Have you seen them?  And what great food.  They are always careful to keep the secret ingredient of their tasty batter - salt - under wraps.  It is amazing how they managed to take one of the world's healthiest meats and turn it into a lethal death trap.  Forget avian flu - Cluckin Bell's deep-fried carrion has been killing people for decades.  A visit to Cluckin' Bell leaves a thin film of grease and dirt all over your body that takes days to wash off... and that's why we love it.  Stop off for a Mighty Cluck.  Only 99c!  That's cheaper than water!   Or try the Stuffed Pollo Todo Frito.  It's an entire chicken stuffed with mashed potatoes and gravy then deep fried!  Awesome.",
        "translated": "铛铛钟拍出了史上最好的电视广告，你看了吗？食物本身也很好。他们一直把美味秘方——多加盐——用面糊藏得严严实实。他们用世界上最健康的肉做出了致命的死亡陷阱。忘了禽流感吧，铛铛钟的油炸腐肉已经毒害了人们数十年。光是走进铛铛钟，你的身上就会沾上一层油和灰尘，花好几天才能洗掉... 所以我们才爱铛铛钟啊。来一个全能鸡胸堡吧，只要99美分！比矿泉水都便宜！也可以试试往整只鸡里填上土豆泥和肉汁，然后油炸而成的炸鸡大杂烩！味道好极了。",
