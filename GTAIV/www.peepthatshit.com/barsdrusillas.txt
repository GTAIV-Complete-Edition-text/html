;0xE76DAC16=Liberty City's Little Italy neighborhood, nestled between Suffolk and City Hall, takes all the traditions of Italy and packs them into one place.  If gluttony, violence and misogyny are your bag, come pay a visit.  Please, no moronic mafia jokes.  The mafia have all gone legit and are running defense companies and restaurant chains.  Swallowed up by the surrounding areas over the years, all that remains of the once-legendary birthplace of the American mafia is a couple of streets with over-priced restaurants that charge $25 for a dollar's worth of spaghetti, pushy waiters who don't wash after wiping and tacky souvenir shops.  However, there is still some good food to be found in Little Italy - and even the odd mobster, if you know where to look.  With its exposed brick, wooden floors and checkered tablecloths, Drusilla's is a traditional, family-run Italian restaurant that has been serving up home-made pizza, pasta and salmonella tortellini for decades.   So grab a tight sweater, light a cigarette, drive your girl to Drusilla's on the back of a scooter, and come suck down a few carafes of cheap red wine until you put your fist through her face for embarrassing you in front of your friends.  Stupid bitch.      
0xE76DAC16=自由城的小意大利坐落在Suffolk和市政厅之间，意大利的所有传统汇集于此。如果暴食、暴力、厌女是你的菜，务必来这里试试。请不要讲愚蠢的黑手党笑话。黑手党早就干起了合法生意，改行做防务公司和餐饮连锁了。小意大利被附近的区域长期蚕食，辉煌一时的美国黑手党的诞生之地如今只剩下了几条街，街上只有俗气的纪念品店和价格虚高的餐馆，只值一块的意大利面能卖到25块，还有擦完屁股不洗手的死缠烂打的服务员。不过，小意大利还是有不错的食物的，有时甚至能找到黑帮成员(只要你知道要去哪儿找)。外露的砖面、木制的地板、格子的桌布，Drusilla's是一家传统的家庭经营餐馆，数十年来一直出售自制披萨、意面和意大利饺子。穿上厚厚的毛衣，点上一支香烟，骑着踏板车带女友取Drusilla's吃上一顿吧。然后再吹几支便宜红酒，直到女朋友让你在朋友面前颜面尽失，给她脸上来了一拳为止。傻逼娘们。
