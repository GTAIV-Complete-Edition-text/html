;0x0AA36C32=You can't visit Liberty City and not go to a diner.  The diner is an American icon, a place where people from all walks of life can gather together to order from a menu of 700 items, all frozen and waiting in the back to be deep fried in syrup or ketchup. If you are looking for an authentic, no-frills diner experience without all the faux-retro trash and gum under every table, go somewhere else. If, on the other hand, you are looking for a phony theme diner experience that is a superficial simulation of the real thing, then head to the 69th Street Diner in Broker's Hove Beach, a working-class (i.e. poor) neighborhood with a large Eastern European population.  Bright lighting, plastic seats, bitter coffee, shit stains on the toilet and a bubbling undercurrent of hostility.  What more could you ask for?  How about food poisoning?  Don't worry. It's more or less guaranteed. Forget the tip at your own peril.
