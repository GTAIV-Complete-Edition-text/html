;0x14BC608C=At the southern tip of Broker lies Firefly Island's historic boardwalk and amusement park.  Arguably 100 years past its prime, a trip to Firefly Island still makes for a fun afternoon by the sea, especially when a dead fish washes up.  What could be more of an adrenaline rush than riding a rickety old wooden roller-coaster?!  Make a beeline for the Screamer, the Parachute Jump or the Liberty Eye.
