;0xCA15254E=The Civilization Committee is a largely inefficient organization where representatives from nations around the world are supposed to decide on the best course of action in the event of an international conflict.  In reality, they talk a lot, do very little, don't pay their traffic tickets, and eat amazing meals while half the world is dying of disease and starvation.  Great work, guys.  Wisely ignored by the U.S. administration in any case, this is more of a nice spot to take some photos by the Humboldt River River than anything of political significance.
