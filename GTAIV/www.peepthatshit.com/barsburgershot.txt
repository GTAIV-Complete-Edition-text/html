;0xFF1F000A=It looks like a delicious burger, it smells like a delicious burger so it must be a delicious burger!  Burger Shot has paid aroma and taste scientists millions to devise that smell and taste that has you coming back for more.  Don't listen to all those scare-mongering documentaries on TV about worm meat, diseased off-cuts and mutant lab cows.   It's just hippy propaganda designed to make you feel guilty about enjoying greasy food and being American.  Burger Shot is the global fast food chain where the burgers just keep on getting bigger.  The new Heartstopper is a 6lb monstrosity of cheese and livestock matter that might just give you a stroke.  What more can you ask for?  How about half off your order if you have actually had a stroke and half your face has gone numb?  Now that's a great deal.
