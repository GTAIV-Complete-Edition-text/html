;0x5A2BF589=The site of the Liberty City World Fair in the 1960's, for some reason we've left up the skeleton of what was supposed to symbolize progress.  Meadows Park has the famous Monoglobe and Liberty State Pavilion Tower and is a must-see for any visitor to Dukes.  Unlike most other things in Dukes.         
0x5A2BF589=上世纪60年代，自由城世博会的场地。出于某种原因，我们保留了象征发展的骨架。草地公园有着知名的巨型地球仪和自由州节庆塔，是来Dukes观光的必去之地。和Dukes的其他地方大不相同。
