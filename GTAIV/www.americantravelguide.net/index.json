The men kiss, the women don't shave and the children drink wine.",

It is quite evident that those with a healthy workaholic manner got out 300 years ago.",

Relax. Kick off your Derriere shoes, put your feet up on your Krapea table, order a deep-pan from Pizza This, take a slurp of your Bean Machine gunkaccino, crack open a Piswasser and engage in some hand-to-gland combat to the finest Russian adult entertainment. You don't need to leave America to know that it's the greatest country in the world!",
