Then I got bombed on whisky and PCP one night and ended up holding up a liquor store. Seemed like a good idea at the time! Now I'm three years into a life sentence at the Alderney State Correctional Facility. I am sharing a cell (and all too often a bed) with a psychotic biker called Digger who makes me shave my legs. I am trying to stay positive and it would be great to hear from some of my old high school buddies. Sometimes it's hard to remember what life was like before I became Digger's bitch. Please write to me or come visit! Bring cigarettes if you can. Hope you're all well.",
