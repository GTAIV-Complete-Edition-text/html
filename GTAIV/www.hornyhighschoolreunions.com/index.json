You forget where you are for a moment. You remember her.  The tail lights ahead blur into a sea of tail lights years ago - it's you and your friends - in high school - leaning against the trunks of cars. You were actually happy. And she's there. Her face, so vibrant in the night at your favorite spot, drinking beers while the music blared out of car windows. You wanted those lips. You wanted to taste. You still do.  You come to - your hand is in your pants - your face is strewn with tears. And your car is slowly wrapping, warping, screeching with piercing intensity, around a streetlight.",
        "translated": "MP3随机切到了那首歌，罪恶的快感暗暗涌起。一天辛苦的工作后，你在漆黑的高速公路上开着车回家。副歌响起，让你一时忘记自己身在何处。你想起了她。前车的尾灯逐渐模糊，化为多年前的朦胧光景——那时还在高中，身旁是那些朋友，一起靠在车的后备箱上。那时的你还是快乐的。她也在那里。晚上，在你最喜欢的地方，她的脸庞是那么清秀动人，喝着啤酒，歌声透过车窗传来。你渴望那双唇，渴望品尝它们，至今仍是如此。你的性致来了，一手伸进裤裆，脸上洒满泪水。你的车剐着、擦着，与路灯亲密接触，发出刺耳的尖声。",
