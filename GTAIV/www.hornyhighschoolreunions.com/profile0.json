Nobody has spoken to me since. What did I do? Who has my clothes? I knew that vodka gelatin bowl was a mistake. I blame that bastard Jerkins. This has been tearing me up for years now. I have a complete blackout...my last memory was trying to make out with Jugs Julie (sorry Julie - I misinterpreted your facial tic as a come-on). If anybody knows what happened, please send me a message. Come on - it can't be that bad?????",
