Now, after a couple of clever ads featuring ugly men hooking up with porn stars, and a really catchy radio jingle, Piswasser has become one of the best-known and most overpriced lagers in the world.  That's because you can take the cheapest swill made in a country, export it, and dummies that want to appear sophisticated will guzzle the stuff.",
