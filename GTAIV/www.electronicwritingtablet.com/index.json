        "original": "Tablet PCs are the future. They have been the next big thing for 30 years! Tablet PCs work just like traditional pen and paper except they cost $2,000 and require electricity. They are heavier than a TV, more expensive than a laptop and come with a full 15 minutes of battery time. Who wants to use one of those fiddly little PDAs when you can lug a flat-screen monitor around on your back? Who wants to type 90 words a minute when you can spend twice as long writing them onto a computer screen with a digital pen and a system that doesn't recognize your handwriting? Why scrawl a girl's number on the back of a cigarette packet when you can impress her by taking ten minutes to boot up your electronic clipboard? Why type an email when you can convert it into meaningless gibberish with handwriting-recognition software?",
        "translated": "平板电脑才是未来。它会成为未来30年最大的变革！平板电脑的功能和传统的纸笔一样，只是要花$2000，还需要供电。平板电脑比电视还重，比笔记本还贵，电池续航只有15分钟。既然能背着一大块平板电视走了，谁还会需要麻烦的小型PDA？既然能用手写笔和手写不识别系统输入了，谁还会花上更短的时间往电脑上打字？既然能花十分钟启动你的电子记事本，给姑娘留下深刻印象，何必把人家的电话记在香烟盒子上？既然识别软件能把手写笔记转换成狗屁不通的乱码，何必用键盘手敲邮件？",
