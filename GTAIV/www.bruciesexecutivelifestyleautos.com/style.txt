;0xA943920B=It's life, not a dress rehearsal. Dress to impress, not to distress. I think nothing of dropping $200 on a pair of silk boxer shorts.

;0xD90D9B25=When I head out in the evening, I go with a pair of Gutter & Blood trousers, a Derriere shirt, Didier Sachs loafers and a Crowex watch. All black, all very tight. It has to be tight. You need to show off the body. Oil it up and get out there. Sometimes I mix things up with some fitted Unleaded jeans and a leisure blazer. Or some Hinterland camo pants, a low-cut white tanktop and sandals (work that pedicure!). I'm urban as fuck! I'm street style, but I'm also VIP. I invented hip hop.

;0x48987DDE=Most importantly... Accessorize! Never forget the bling. Women love jewelry on a man just as much as they love the spinning rims on your pimped-out ride. Jewelry says - 'I've arrived', 'I am the fucking man'.

;0x5D4646EC=Remember - you're metromacho now! I couldn't be any more heterosexual but I certainly don't mind being a gay icon. If guys want to watch me take my post-workout shower, I'm not going to draw the curtain. The only cock I love is my own, but I don't mind showing it off.
