;0x505AF536=Is your hairline receding as quickly as your waistline is expanding? These days there are no excuses for being ugly. Last year, I spent over $100,000 on calf implants, a hair transplant and a set of veneers made from imported Chinese porcelain. I think that the results speak for themselves. My cock-job was the best $20,000 I ever spent. Remember - girth and mirth rhyme for a reason.
