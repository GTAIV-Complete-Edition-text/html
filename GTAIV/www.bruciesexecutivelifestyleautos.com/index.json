Can you imagine waking up every morning and wanting to look at yourself for hours in the mirror?  People try to label me as metrosexual and heteroflexible but I like to describe myself as a metromacho, a neo-narcissist:  the ultimate blend of masculinity and desirability.  The nineties were the age of the New Man.  Now it's time for the Ultimate Man.  A man with a blog, PDA,  20-inch rims, the 10-inch cock, the perfect body, big guns and the rock star lifestyle.  You want it all, you deserve it all.  I've got it all and more besides. And I can give it to you, for a price.  Success is measured by looks, money, status and power.  I tick all those boxes and I can show you how to get there.  I can make you believe that you're better than you are.  Like my cars, I'm well-tuned, fuel-injected, super-charged, streeted up, blinged-out and highly-polished.  I'm VIP. Nobody brings as much to the table as me.  I bring the table to the table.  I set up a table and flip food into my hat, like at a hibachi.   Don't be a bottom-feeder all your life.  Experience what it's like to be at the very top of the food chain.",
