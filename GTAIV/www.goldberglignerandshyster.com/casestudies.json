He won multiple humanitarian awards for bringing Mollis to market in the late nineties and solved the problem of juvenile erectile dysfunction globally.  Named \"the untouchable CEO\" in the Liberty Tree (Sept. 15th 2000), Eastman gives a percentage of his money to charity and has three girls and a wife. Goldberg, Ligner and Shyster saw this as a challenge.  Taking down a prize such as this was a top goal.",
