;0x6FCB0155=The loss of a loved one is the most heartbreaking moment in your life, next to when you miss out on an important promotion at work or when you got laughed at a lot as a kid for having odd genitals. The funeral business in this country has created a multibillion dollar industry out of what used to be a sacred and celebratory event - burning your loved ones to a crisp. Gone are the days when a family member near death was lovingly dragged out into the yard, tastefully surrounded with unwanted furniture and family members and set ablaze. The surviving family then held each other close as the spirit of their loved one soared to the sky - and their possessions soared into Ye Olde Pawne Shoppe. Now a nameless stranger carts away the body while you are still mourning, drains out their blood, fills them full of embalming fluid, violates their privates, puts makeup on them and charges $60,000 for a cafeteria-like service, gaudy casket, shitty overpriced flowers and a hole in the ground next to someone you've never met.
0x6FCB0155=亲人离世一定是你一生中最心痛的时刻，不亚于职场上失去晋升机会，或者是鸡巴太小被人笑话。把已逝亲人烧得干干净净是一项神圣的庆典，也使得美国的殡葬业发展成了产值数十亿的产业。过去，临死的亲人会被拖到院子里，堆上没人要的家具，一家人打扮干净举行火葬。生者紧紧拥抱，死者灵魂飞升，遗产拿去典当。但这种日子一去不复返了。如今，哀悼还没完成，陌生的工人就拉走了尸体，放干净血，打上防腐剂，还不忘摸一摸私处，最后才打扮好遗容。完了还问你收60000块钱的服务费，搞得跟咖啡厅一样：花哨的棺材，贵的离谱的假花，挖个坑埋了以后连旁边埋的是谁都不认识。
