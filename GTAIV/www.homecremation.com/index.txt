;0x6FCB0155=The loss of a loved one is the most heartbreaking moment in your life, next to when you miss out on an important promotion at work or when you got laughed at a lot as a kid for having odd genitals. The funeral business in this country has created a multibillion dollar industry out of what used to be a sacred and celebratory event - burning your loved ones to a crisp. Gone are the days when a family member near death was lovingly dragged out into the yard, tastefully surrounded with unwanted furniture and family members and set ablaze. The surviving family then held each other close as the spirit of their loved one soared to the sky - and their possessions soared into Ye Olde Pawne Shoppe. Now a nameless stranger carts away the body while you are still mourning, drains out their blood, fills them full of embalming fluid, violates their privates, puts makeup on them and charges $60,000 for a cafeteria-like service, gaudy casket, shitty overpriced flowers and a hole in the ground next to someone you've never met.
