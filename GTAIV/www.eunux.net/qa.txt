0x04A86F2E=

;0x02272FEB=Eunux is known primarily for its use in servers.  However, by the end of the year, we hope to have cornered 0.000008% of the desktop market.  It's a bit of a Catch-22.  If we become too mainstream, if too many people start using free software, all our fanboys will desert us for a more 1337 hobby.  But we're the most popular server operating system in the world.

For being a drone that just helps crank forward the machine?  Democracy dies when laziness sets in, and you are being lazy.  To not try to understand the machine is to get tangled in the gears and crunched into pieces. c0d3rz are the shizzit.

0x4F72DEE4=

;0x14F3E330=It's easy.  Delete everything on your computer (after backing up all your illegal mp3s and warez!) and download Eunux.  There have been some issues with installation but be patient, it may take a few days or even a week to get it operating properly.    
0x14F3E330=

0xD9B4981B=

;0x7440A54A=They can't.  It's not allowed.  Eunux is just for men.  Girls don't understand the importance of acronyms.  Are you a real girl?  Do you want to hear a binary joke?  Can you send some photos? Will you dress up as a mythical beast for $$?

;0xD5E37A42=Is Eunux communist?
0xD5E37A42=

;0xAB643610=NO!!!!  When will you people shut up about communism?!!! Eunux is free, collectively owned and distributed, and maintained by a community rather than private individuals.  Does that sound communist to you?  It's socialist, for fuck's sake.

;0x4B33DC25=Do you find it fun wondering whether every email is going to corrupt your system?  Do you like playing with worms and spreading them to all your friends?  To$$ OS is responsible for all known viruses including Bird Flu, SARS and Ebola. Virus writers do not want to touch Eunux which means it is immune to annoying spyware.  Do you get turned on by total strangers fucking in your hard drive?
