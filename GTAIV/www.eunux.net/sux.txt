;0xA2B2AEA7=Sux was chosen as the mascot for Eunux by the man who began it all. Visionary Scandinavian founder Eunus one day said "I don't want to pay money for things, I'll make a version myself." Eunus has been quoted as saying, "Stop focusing on the fucking sea cucumber. I don't have to explain myself to you. I am the self-appointed god of the open source movement. I know it's a pointless animal. I just like sea cucumbers. It's better than being a blue-screen-loving proprietary software sheep."
0xA2B2AEA7=Eunux 之父亲自选定 Sux 作为系统的吉祥物。有一天，来自斯堪的纳维亚半岛的富有远见的创始人 Eunus 说：「我不想给他们付钱，自己做一版吧。」Eunus 有句名言「别老想着那个傻逼海黄瓜了。我没必要向你解释自己。我自封为开源运动的神。我知道那就是个没有意义的动物。我就是喜欢海黄瓜。总比你们这些喜欢蓝屏的版权软件菜鸡强。」

;0xCE38BADB=We at Eunux.net believe that a sea cucumber is a strong symbol for our user-base because it is a sausage shaped, solitary, malodorous, nocturnal creature with soft spines and warty bumps. It's asexual and has been known to vomit its internal organs when it gets defensive, in a similar way to a Eunux fanboy when someone challenges the omnipotence of his OS after he's been living on spray cheese for two months. 
0xCE38BADB=我们 Eunux.net 相信海黄瓜是我们用户基本盘的强大象征，它是一种香肠形的、恶臭的夜行独居生物，有着柔软的脊柱和肿块。而且还是无性生物，防御时会吐出自己身上的器官，类似于靠奶酪过了两个月的 Eunux 粉丝，被人质疑自己系统的全能性时就会呕吐。
