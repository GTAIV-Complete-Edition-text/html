;0xA2B2AEA7=Sux was chosen as the mascot for Eunux by the man who began it all. Visionary Scandinavian founder Eunus one day said "I don't want to pay money for things, I'll make a version myself." Eunus has been quoted as saying, "Stop focusing on the fucking sea cucumber. I don't have to explain myself to you. I am the self-appointed god of the open source movement. I know it's a pointless animal. I just like sea cucumbers. It's better than being a blue-screen-loving proprietary software sheep."

;0xCE38BADB=We at Eunux.net believe that a sea cucumber is a strong symbol for our user-base because it is a sausage shaped, solitary, malodorous, nocturnal creature with soft spines and warty bumps. It's asexual and has been known to vomit its internal organs when it gets defensive, in a similar way to a Eunux fanboy when someone challenges the omnipotence of his OS after he's been living on spray cheese for two months.
