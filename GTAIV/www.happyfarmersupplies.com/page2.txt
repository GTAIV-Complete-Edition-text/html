;0x4CE78C72=It doesn't matter if you have a fish tank and a desk lamp on the top shelf of your closet or a subterranean greenhouse the size of a football field, there is always money to be made from a good-quality batch of tomatoes.  Just remember that the tomato business is highly competitive and, if you want to avoid waking up with the business end of a gun in your ass, make sure that you are not muscling in on the wrong person's turf.  My advice is to dip your crop in some chloroform, come up with a name like Columbian Headwarp and set up shop near a university.
0x4CE78C72=不论你是用衣柜上层的鱼缸和台灯种的，还是用足球场大小的地下温室种的，高品质的西红柿总能让你赚钱。但有一点需要铭记在心，西红柿这行竞争激烈，如果你不想醒来时被人拿枪指着，就此告别这行，那就别到别人的地盘上撒野。我的建议是用哥罗芳泡一遍你的收成，取个「哥伦比亚幻境」之类的名字卖给大学生。

0xFD4FD7BC=快乐农民，我的西红柿上长了虫子，叶子也变黄了。

;0x23E1BBA1=Hey Tomfet, thanks for your message.  Damn right you need help.  Make a mix of bat shit and gasoline and burn it near your plants.  Spider mites will flee.         
0x23E1BBA1=嘿，Tomfet，感谢你的来信。太对了，你确实需要帮助。把蝙蝠屎和汽油混在一起点燃，红蜘蛛就会消失了。

;0x33E12044=My name's Robert and I live in Pittsville, Kentucky.  I have just killed my young family and moved out to the suburbs to get away from the crime and um, people in the city.  I really want to get into growing tomatoes and maybe make my own dynamite and booby traps to keep immigrants off my land.  What is the best combination of soil and fertilizer?  Also, what strain should I try, and will I meet God?
0x33E12044=我叫Robert，现居肯塔基州皮兹维尔。最近我杀害了全家人，搬到乡下逃避罪责和... 城里人。我很想学习西红柿种植，说不定还会自制炸药和诡雷陷阱，让移民靠近不了我的地盘。土壤和肥料的混合比例有什么讲究吗？还有，我应该选择什么品种？我能见到上帝吗？

;0xDE6ABB14=RPaulsen - Forget soil.  This is the 21st century, man!  You've got to take it high-tech.  I'm talking weapons-grade, mutant tomatoes grown upside down in an aqueous solution of nutrients and hormones.  The aim is to weed out all the useless males and to develop a master-race of genetically-ludicrous females.  Like in Los Santos.
0xDE6ABB14=RPaulsen，忘记土壤吧。这都21世纪了，老兄！能不能来点高科技。比如说武器级的突变西红柿，在营养液和生长激素里倒着长的那种。重点在于消除所有没用的雄株，培育拥有最优秀基因的雌株。和洛圣都一个道理。

;0xAF229B1E=The Herbal Clown - I do just grow tomatoes, why would anybody ever grow anything else?  Sometimes when I really want to fly I do have some portabello mushroom tea, and then I end up sitting on a cliff and screaming at birds for three days, getting massively sunburned.
0xAF229B1E=The Herbal Clown，我种的就是西红柿，为什么会有人想种别的东西？不过想飘一下的时候我确实会用龙葵菇泡杯茶，最后抽着大麻朝飞鸟叫上三天，被太阳晒成人干。
