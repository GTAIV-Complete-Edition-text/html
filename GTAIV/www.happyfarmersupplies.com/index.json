I personally have an indoor grow room with 35 Sodium, Halide and Fluorescent lights.  Who says that farming can't be cool?  Who says that farmers are all socially-awkward sexual deviants?  Whether you decide to do it as a hobby with friends and family or to turn it into a massive tax-free business with coast-to-coast distribution channels, there is something immensely satisfying about home farming.  My tomatoes netted me $50,000 in extra cash last year!",

        "original": "The tomato has always puzzled and divided the critics - it straddles the middle ground between fruit and vegetable.  A miracle of nature, or the spawn of Satan?  Right wing radicals will tell you that eating tomatoes will turn you into an unemployable, impotent psychopath who spends all day sleeping and watching cartoons.  They will also tell you that dinosaurs didn't exist, so I wouldn't pay too much attention to them.  Since cavemen times, people have used tomatoes and they are often misunderstood or stereotyped.  Tomatoes are great cancer fighters or, at least, they will make you forget that you have it.  I want to share my years of select breeding experience with you.  I will show you how to steal electricity from your neighbors so that the authorities don't come knocking when your studio apartment is using more power than a third-world country.  I am not talking about that low-quality schwag from Mexico that gives you the shits and a headache.  I will teach you the secrets of seed-blending and genetic modification that create mind-blowing superstrains of tomatoes to sell for twice the price.",
        "translated": "西红柿长期困惑着人类，也引起过争执，它一直处在蔬菜和水果的中间地带。西红柿是自然的奇迹，还是撒旦的造物？右翼的激进分子会告诉你，吃了西红柿后，你就会变成残废的阳痿疯子，整天不是睡觉就是看卡通片。他们还会跟你说恐龙并不存在，所以我会无视他们的说法。早在穴居时代，人类就吃过西红柿了，但吃西红柿的人很容易被误解、贴上标签。西红柿具有抗癌功效，至少它能让你忘记自己得了癌症。我想和你们分享多年积累下来的选种经验。我会教你们如何偷拉邻居家的电线，这样执法机构就不会因为你家用电比一整个第三世界国家还多，上门查你电表了。我所说的并不是墨西哥产的劣质草，吃了以后又难受又头疼。我会教你们杂交育种和基因编辑，创造出如梦似幻的超级品种，可以卖出普通西红柿两倍的价钱。",
