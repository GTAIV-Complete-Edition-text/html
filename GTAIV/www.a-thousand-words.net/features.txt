;0x30C273D8=Captions like "Ooops! I don't think he wanted to do that!" are so funny! They are also a great tool to enable girls with low self-esteem to fish for compliments by posting hot pictures of themselves under the line "Ugggh! I look so fat in this photo!" To tell her she's fat, see Comments, below.

;0x2C7C2585=A picture says a thousand words but also adds ten pounds and exposes all the flaws that your psyche suppresses as a defense mechanism when you look in the mirror. Smooth over that bald stump that was an arm before the accident, pencil in that cleavage, blitz that acne, melt away that cellulite, beef up that crotch. Use a sepia effect - it appears more artsy-fartsy and makes ugly people look better. Do fun things like transpose your mom's head onto a porn star's body and send it to your local newspaper. The possibilities of photo editing are endless. Essential for egomaniacs who like to crop friends out of photos in order to focus attention on themselves.
