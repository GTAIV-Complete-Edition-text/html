I showed up at his work today with this huge fish that sings a song when you squeeze it.  Love is all-consuming.  Sometimes I feel that I love him so much that I shouldn't try to write it down here.  It's too fragile and perfect to be judged and picked apart by horny strangers.  Words cannot describe jhow I feel.  He's an amazing guy who makes me smile forever.
