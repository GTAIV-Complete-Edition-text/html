I dont know why.  I think rolling around in the campus fountain in tears says a lot about loss.  He's such a bastard and hes ruined my life but I still love him more than anything in the world.  Nobody will ever love him more than me.  Not even a three legged poodle.",

I need a ginseng enema or something, cause Wednesday I spent thae day staring at the ceiling and looking at my pink nightstand and wanting to throw up from all the chocolate I ate.  I watched some documentary where elephants have sex.  ELEPHANTS HAVE HUGE ONES.  The say elephants never forget, but I don't think I'll forget seeing that either.  I would have gotten excited, but watching elephants do it reminds me of the time I walked in on my parents and then I start to cry.  Mom made me promise to stop joking about it on holidays by picking up the cat and humping it.  She did.  Sound.  Just.  Like.  A.  Cat.   It's why I hate cats.      Tomorrow I meet Sitva to study.  He and I are in the same Poly Sci class and I can't understand a word he says in pastafarian or Spanglish or Heswalli or whatever language it is, but I can tell you if he didn't have such massive acne I'd totally do him. ^o^ *lol*        I don't know why, but I felt like posting right now, even though I'm supposed to be at the library, yet here I am, writing.

I shower him with affection and tracking beacons and he tears out my heart and stamps it on the floor.  How could you throw away something so special, Jack?  Don't all men want a woman chasing them?
