;0xBCC0F44B=wired on expresso thinking that this is the happiest that I've ever been.  I never knew how having a blog would change my life.  To think, any man, 55, balding, can read my intimate thoughts.  Amazing!  Tomorrow Jack and I have been going out for 3 days.  I showed up at his work today with this huge fish that sings a song when you squeeze it.  Love is all-consuming.  Sometimes I feel that I love him so much that I shouldn't try to write it down here.  It's too fragile and perfect to be judged and picked apart by horny strangers.  Words cannot describe jhow I feel.  He's an amazing guy who makes me smile forever.  My friend shelly says I've lost site of reality.  Yeah right    
0xBCC0F44B=店里，喝着意式咖啡，大概这就是我最快乐的时刻吧。从未想到写博客可以改变我的人生。想想吧，就连55岁的秃顶老头都能读到我的私密想法。太惊人了！明天就是我和Jack交往的第三天了。今天我去了他工作的地方，掏出了这条用手一压就会唱歌的大鱼。爱情让人失去头脑。有时我都觉得不该把对他热烈的爱写在这个博客里了。这份爱太完美了，太脆弱了，不适合放在博客上给饥渴的陌生人指指点点。这种感受无以言表。他是那么的迷人，让我的脸上一直挂着笑容。朋友Shelly说我的眼里已经看不见现实了。

;0xF3E244D0=A little sparrow is hopping along the wall outside the window and for a second I started to imagine it under a huge magnifying glass in the midday sun.  I must try to remember the breathing exericises that Dr. Carter taught me.    
0xF3E244D0=一只小麻雀在窗外的围墙上蹦跶。有那么一会儿，我开始想象它的上面还有一个巨大的放大镜，汇集着正午的阳光。必须回想一下Carter医生教我的呼吸训练了。

0x4D359523=人生中最美好的事物往往是最简单的，不是吗？海洋的声音，割草的香气，金钱，手中握着绳子的触感。

;0x4DA0AF76=The girls on the floor above threw a slumber party last night.  It was SUCH a cool night.  The guys kept phoning us and even sent a text message asking for a panty color poll at one point!  It was WILD!  I smoked my first jpoint and there was a big pillow fight at the end.  I might have got a bit carried away when I cracked that girl with the fire extinguisher but it was the most fun I ever had.    
0x4DA0AF76=住楼上的女生昨晚开了个睡衣派对。这一夜实在太酷了。男生一直打电话过来，还发了条短信调查我们内裤的颜色！太狂野了！我抽了人生中的第一支大麻，最后还来了场枕头大战。可能是上头了，有个姑娘被我拿灭火器砸了一下，不过这是我最快乐的经历。

;0x31D7D03D=Who were we in high school?  How where we perceived by others?  If anyone knew me in high school, please send me a message saying what you thought of me back then.  Be brutally honest.  I won't get mad.    
0x31D7D03D=高中时我是怎样的人？别人又是怎么看我的？如果有人高中时认识我，请告诉我当时对我的看法。一定要实话实说，我不会生气的。

;0x7094AD7B=And now for my heart report!!!  Jack is everything I ever dreamed of in a man.  Its amazing to be with someone who actually has a sex drive and knows how to smack me around.  For the record, Terry, its not normal and it doesn't happen to every guy!!!!  My love for Jack consumes me and I cant get him out of my head.  He came over to my room last night and I introduced him to my security blanket, Muffy.  I asked him over and over again if he would love me forever.  He's so cconsiderate and tried to sneak out of my room without waking me this morning but I caught him!!!! I deleted all the female numbers from Jack's cell phone when he was in the shower.  Why would he need those now that he has me? 
0x7094AD7B=接着汇报感情生活吧！！！Jack是我理想中的完美男人。和一个真正有性欲，又知道怎么玩我的人在一起太美妙了。严正声明，Terry，你那是少数中的少数，大部分人都不会是这种情况！！！！我的脑子里满是对Jack的爱，无法让他从脑海中淡出片刻。昨晚他进了我的房间，我向他介绍了我的安慰毯子Muffy。我反反复复地问他会不会爱我一辈子。他太体贴了，今早偷偷溜出房间，不想吵醒我，但还是被我发现了！！！！趁他洗澡的时候，我把他手机里其他女人的号码删光了。已经有我了，还需要存其他女人的号码吗？

;0x33FC9903=I might be suffocating right now.    
0x33FC9903=我有点透不过气了。

;0xF920227F=Things with Jack are so serious. This is it.  I mean, I thought I knew what "it" was a million times, but this is like when you get on a bus and somebody looks you in the eye and tells you to go to the back and then as you do you have to look away, and there's someone behind you with headphones on and the cacophony of noises and beats and drums and horns and emotions and the front man screams out a song that fights into every pore every piece of your soul until it breaks in half with an earth shattering thud that resonates across the city, echoing, echoing.  Echoing.  Echoing.  Echoing.    
0xF920227F=和Jack在一起时的感觉太真了。就是这种感觉。我一直都知道这是什么感觉，我可太熟悉了。但这次更像是你乘上了公交车，有人望向了你的眼睛，叫你往后面走，为了往后走你就挪开了视线，这时身后上来了一个戴着耳机的人，耳中是嘈杂的噪音、节拍、鼓点、号声、感情，身前的男人尖声唱起了歌，钻进了灵魂的每一个小孔、每一条缝隙。直到一声撕裂地球的撞击声响起，这种感觉碎成了两半，只剩撞击声在城市里回响，回响，回响，回响，回响。

;0x34B9E8F1=I just left Jack 23 voicemails saying 'I love you more than the last time'.  I hope he knows how much I care.  I'll break out his car windows if he doesn't.      
0x34B9E8F1=我给Jack的语音信箱发了23条「我比之前更加爱你」。希望他知道我有多在乎他。不接受我就砸了他的车窗。
