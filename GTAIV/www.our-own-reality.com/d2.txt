;0xE1EA4C81=Tyrone 'The Tower' Hancock just can't stop screwing up and we love him for it.  A basketball legend during the 1980's with the Liberty Penetrators, he has spent the last 20 years making headlines off the court for all the wrong reasons.  His battle with drugs and alcohol has been so well-publicized for so long that it is now almost impossible to imagine news without it.  'The Leaning Tower' was arrested by police in Liberty City's Middle Park early this morning for drunken behavior that culminated with him french-kissing a homeless man.  "It's all a blur." Hancock told reporters at the scene, "One minute, I was in a nightclub with a chick named Gloria, the next thing I know, it's daylight and I'm dry-humping a toothless bum on a park bench and slapping him in the face for the rest of his Burger Shot he went dumpster diving for.  I'll be honest with you - it's a bit of a low point.  I just hope my wife can forgive me."  To buy a pair of Eris Hancocks or for more exceptional footwear at unbeatable prices, please visit
