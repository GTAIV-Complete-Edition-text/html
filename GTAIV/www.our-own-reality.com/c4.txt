;0xAA19F169=In response to accusations that politics is too out of touch with popular culture, the two frontrunners in the race for governor, John Hunter and Michael Graves, took part an online flame war last night.  Hunter kicked off with, "I M in ur state houz steelin ur votez."  Graves hit back with, "Ohnoes!!1 I M IN UR DISTRICT PWNIN UR SENIORS!!!!"  The debate quickly descended into insults about libido.  A generation of lonely teenagers looked on in horror from their bedrooms.
0xAA19F169=为了回应政治与流行文化过于脱节的指责，自由州的两大州长候选人，John Hunter和Michael Graves，昨晚进入在线聊天室进行了一次网络对喷。Hunter先手进攻：「窝就在你的底盘，窝还药偷你的选票。」Graves回击道：「偶好怕怕哦！！偶在泥老巢干翻泥全家！！！！」这场辩论很快就转向了对对方性能力进行嘲讽和侮辱。孤独的青少年在自家卧室里惊恐地围观了全程。

;0xC6248CB8=Samantha Muldoon has changed her religion 3 times in the last week.  She converted to Buddhism on a four-day trip to India but then realized on her return to the US that Kabbalah was a far more relevant faith and switched two days later.  However, she issued a press release yesterday to say that, following a visit from a sinister man in the dead of the night, she is now dedicating her life and, one would imagine, most of her money to the worship of Epsilon.  Is this the beginning of a breakdown?  Is the failure of her 20-minute marriage to Kirk Simplex taking its toll?  Is this news?  I'm just not sure any more...
0xC6248CB8=Samantha Muldoon在上周短短的七天之内变更了三次信仰。她在为期四天的印度之旅中皈依了佛教，之后又觉得犹太人的神秘哲学更有意义，在回到美国的两天以后改信卡巴拉教。然而，她在昨日发布的新闻稿中宣布，一名凶恶的男子深夜造访之后，她决定将她的一生以及全部的财产统统献给埃普西隆。这会是她崩溃的起点吗？这是她与Kirk Simplex短短二十分钟的失败婚姻酿成的后果吗？这算是新闻吗？我彻底糊涂了...
