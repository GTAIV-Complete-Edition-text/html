;0xF1787F9B=The McIntosh Meltdown is exceeding all our expectations.  Even since her drug-crazed bender only minutes after checking out of rehab, our investigative journalists had been hounding her day and night in the hope that she would snap and provide us with some more tabloid gold.  And snap she did!  At approximately 2 AM this morning she spotted someone from our team taking photos through her bathroom window and, in what was undoubtedly a heroin-and-coke-fueled rage, she chased him down the street with a CARVING KNIFE!!!  This is clearly a woman on the edge.  Sex.  Drugs.  Alcohol.  Psychopathic behavior.  Kitchen utensils. We couldn't ask for much more.  Apart from a comeback, that is.  The time has come for her to rise again from the ashes and we are going to make it happen.  Stay glued to Our Own Reality for more developments in this incredible story.   This is a war we're winning:  The war on our own reality.
0xF1787F9B=McIntosh塌房的进展完全超出了预期。刚出康复中心没几分钟的她立刻加入了毒品狂欢，自那时起我们就派出了调查记者全天追踪，希望她能突然失控，给我们制造几条八卦猛料。她也确实失控了！今天凌晨两点左右，她发现我们的记者正在浴室窗外偷拍，当场火冒三丈，握着切肉刀冲出家门在大街上追杀记者！！！这无疑是海洛因和可卡因作用下的滔天怒火。她确实是一个危险的刀女。性、药物、酒精、精神病行为、菜刀。她为我们提供的素材已经够多了。最多再来一个卷土重来的新闻。现在，是她浴火重生的时候了，而我们也会努力促成她的复出。密切关注属于我们的真实，获取这一惊人故事的后续发展。这是一场我们必将胜利的战役：与我们自己的现实开战。
