;0xF1787F9B=The McIntosh Meltdown is exceeding all our expectations.  Even since her drug-crazed bender only minutes after checking out of rehab, our investigative journalists had been hounding her day and night in the hope that she would snap and provide us with some more tabloid gold.  And snap she did!  At approximately 2 AM this morning she spotted someone from our team taking photos through her bathroom window and, in what was undoubtedly a heroin-and-coke-fueled rage, she chased him down the street with a CARVING KNIFE!!!  This is clearly a woman on the edge.  Sex.  Drugs.  Alcohol.  Psychopathic behavior.  Kitchen utensils. We couldn't ask for much more.  Apart from a comeback, that is.  The time has come for her to rise again from the ashes and we are going to make it happen.  Stay glued to Our Own Reality for more developments in this incredible story.   This is a war we're winning:  The war on our own reality.
