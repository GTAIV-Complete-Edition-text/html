;0xFEE439CA=Popping, the heartwarming dance-off movie about a kid from the rough part of town who has one chance to make something of his life, is at the top of the box office charts for a second week.  Many are attributing the movie's phenomenal success to its 78-minute training montage in which the main character, Flex, is put through his paces in a dance studio by an older mentor from the neighborhood and a hot upper-middle class ballerina.  Can Flex keep it real while high-kicking in a yellow leotard?  You'll have to go see for yourself.  Truly, this is how it is settled on the streets.
