McTony is condemning him to a life of mediocrity.  The poor kid is going to be a laughing stock if he goes to Rodeo High and he certainly won't be invited to any of my kid's parties,\" snarled one Los Santos trophy wife.  This is McTony's 7th child born out of wedlock in the past six months and we wouldn't be the first to suggest that he is nothing more than a short man with a chip on his shoulder, a cupboard full of Mollis and something to prove.  McTony has little contact with any of his pocket-sized progeny but has insisted that they all wear the line of baby clothes that he designed with his distinctive logo: a yellow M on a red background.",
