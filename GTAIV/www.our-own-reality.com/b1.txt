;0x72A7FE19=Tony McTony, the little guy with the big ego, is back where he loves to be: Looking up into the media spotlight with his hand on his logo.  The diminutive internet entrepreneur and self-titled Algonquinite playboy is suing LC24 magazine for defamation following an article that described him as 'Napoleonic'.  The despotic dwarf, who is notorious for the tyrannical way that he runs his Internet empire, made headlines last year when he bought a theme park and then promptly sacked all the staff after he was turned away from a rollercoaster for failing to meet the minimum height requirements.  His social networking and video sharing websites tapped into the zeitgeist of a narcissistic generation with a burning desire to communicate the minutiae of their moronic lives to total strangers.  He is 2.0 McTony.  He is reported to have put more sexual predators in contact with young children than anybody else in history.  In an interview with the Money Maker last month, McTony said, "Web 2.0 has changed the way that we talk about the internet forever.  Because we changed the name.  I am already working on a roadmap for Web 7.0 where the internet will be installed directly into your pelvis.  It's going to be out of the blogosphere.  Nobody is more next-gen than me."

;0x655331F8=The midget megalomaniac, who was recently voted the 3rd most eligible bachelor under the height of 5'5", has got 15 identical sports cars all monogrammed with the logo that he had designed for himself earlier this year.  When he is not getting ignored by bartenders in Liberty City's hottest nightclubs, McTony likes to spend time at home inventing new buzzwords and eyefinding his own name.  He is outraged at claims in the LC24 article that he has a Napoleon Complex and is "clearly overcompensating for something".  "OMFG.  It just ain't right - Napoleon was five foot two, whereas Tony McTony is five foot three, so it ain't the same at all.", he told Weazel News earlier today, "So what if I rule with an iron fist?  I actually have an iron fist that I keep under my pillow and surprise chicks with when they're lulled into a false sense of security."  What does this all mean to me and you?  Not a lot.  But he's rich and he's short and he's very angry and that makes good television.
