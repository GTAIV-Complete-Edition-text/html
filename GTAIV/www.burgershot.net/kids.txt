;0x6E2F5B73=Kids love fast food. And we love kids! Especially ones who pull their parents into our stores so they can shove shit down their throats and become the type of lazy fuckwad Americans that only care about TV and not democracy. We spend billions every year on aggressively marketing our products to the tween demographic. The younger our customers are, the easier it is to mold their eating preferences for life. Our 'Every Child Deserves To Be Loved' TV campaign has been very successful in encouraging young people to emotionally blackmail their parents into spending money at Burger Shot. Also please note that we give away free fries during every Amber Alert.
