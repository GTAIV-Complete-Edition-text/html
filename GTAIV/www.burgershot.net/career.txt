;0xC1F86FA2=Burger Shot is an equal opportunity employer - we hire lots of teenage dropouts. Our restaurants are a great place to learn a foreign language, including English. We empower our workers, which is why they look so smug when they tell you that "we stopped serving breakfast one second ago". The majority of our staff is under 21, apart from the really old senile people who we like to hire to mop up their own urine. All work is part-time and we do not pay overtime. Most employees last about three weeks. If you make it past a month, we will promote you to Service Expert (no pay raise). We will give you some nominal training, like: how to over-salt food so that people buy more drinks. After all, we don't want to lose our federal tax breaks. However, like a good frat party with a drunk girl, the assembly line approach is the key to our success and we have broken down the burger-making process into a series of mind-numbing repetitive actions. The last thing we want is anyone claiming that they are a skilled worker and demanding minimum wage or benefits. If you think that this sounds bad, try spending a day with our tomato-pickers in Central America. 
0xC1F86FA2=在招聘员工这块，吃得饱汉堡做到了人人平等，我们招聘了很多辍学的年轻人。店里也是个学习外语的好地方，包括英语。我们给了员工自由裁量权，因此他们会自豪地告诉你「早餐时间一秒前刚结束哦」。我们员工的主力军都在21岁以下，剩下的都是打扫卫生的老头老太，一边干活一边尿失禁。所有岗位都是兼职，加班不给钱。大多数员工干了三周就跑了。如果你能干够一个月，我们会升你为服务专家 (工资照旧)。上岗前会稍微进行一些培训，比如怎么放盐可以让顾客多买饮料。毕竟税都减了，肯定要狠狠地赚一把。然而，正如嗨翻天的聚会一定有烂醉的妹子一样，成功的快餐店里一定有流水生产线。汉堡的制作过程被分解成了令人麻木的重复动作。我们最不希望的就是有人说自己是熟练工，开始对最低工资和福利提要求。你要是觉得不行，那就去中美洲摘西红柿，体验一下生活吧。

;0x8E37D485=If flipping burgers is not your thing, why not work in one of our slaughterhouses? Can you imagine slitting throats all day? How many other jobs allow you to use a stun gun and skin animals alive? No experience necessary.
0x8E37D485=如果你觉得自己不是做汉堡的料，为什么不去屠宰岗试试呢？想象一下一整天都在割喉放血是什么感觉？又能有几份工作可以掏电击枪、活剥动物的皮？本岗位无需相关经验。

;0x650372D6= Be very careful how you pronounce onion rings. If it sounds anything like 'union rings', we will sack you on the spot or put in a call to say that you have violated your parole. 
0x650372D6=说「洋葱圈」的时候发音准确一点。要是发音不准，变成了「要同权」之类的意思，我们会马上解雇你，或者报警说你违反了假释相关规定。
