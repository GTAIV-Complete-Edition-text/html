        "original": "Come on! Nobody eats at Burger Shot for the service! Most employees come into work high or drunk so please don't expect too much from them. Don't be surprised if somebody asks you if \"you want fries with that\" when you demand to see the post-teenage-pregnancy manager. They really don't care if your child \"already has that toy\". A word of advice: think twice about pissing off the people who make your food. An ex-con who has just worked a 20-hour shift in a ridiculous burger hat has a very short fuse. It only takes a second to sneeze on a bun or spit in the ice-cream mix and the last thing you want on your tray is a chewed straw or salty mayonnaise.",
        "translated": "别吧！没有人是冲着服务光顾吃得饱汉堡的！我们的大部分员工来上班时不是嗑嗨了就是喝高了，所以别对他们要求太多。要求店员叫早孕的年轻经理过来的时候，也不要对店员回你一句「要配薯条是吗」感到惊讶。他们才不在乎你的小孩「有没有拿过同款玩具」。这里建议一句：对给你做饭的人客气点。连续做了20个小时汉堡的前科犯很容易生气。往面包上打喷嚏、在冰淇淋里吐口水只不过是一下的事情，最后在你餐盘里的可能是咬过的吸管和咸得不行的蛋黄酱。",
