;0x4DAC1D22=Come on! Nobody eats at Burger Shot for the service! Most employees come into work high or drunk so please don't expect too much from them. Don't be surprised if somebody asks you if "you want fries with that" when you demand to see the post-teenage-pregnancy manager. They really don't care if your child "already has that toy". A word of advice: think twice about pissing off the people who make your food. An ex-con who has just worked a 20-hour shift in a ridiculous burger hat has a very short fuse. It only takes a second to sneeze on a bun or spit in the ice-cream mix and the last thing you want on your tray is a chewed straw or salty mayonnaise.
