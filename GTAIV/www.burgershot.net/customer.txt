;0x4DAC1D22=Come on! Nobody eats at Burger Shot for the service! Most employees come into work high or drunk so please don't expect too much from them. Don't be surprised if somebody asks you if "you want fries with that" when you demand to see the post-teenage-pregnancy manager. They really don't care if your child "already has that toy". A word of advice: think twice about pissing off the people who make your food. An ex-con who has just worked a 20-hour shift in a ridiculous burger hat has a very short fuse. It only takes a second to sneeze on a bun or spit in the ice-cream mix and the last thing you want on your tray is a chewed straw or salty mayonnaise.
0x4DAC1D22=别吧！没有人是冲着服务来光顾吃得饱汉堡的！我们大部分来上班的员工都是嗑嗨的，或者是喝醉的，所以不要太指望他们能干什么，找我们那早孕的年轻经理投诉的时候，也不要对店员给你来一句「要配薯条是吗」感到惊讶。他们才不在乎你的小孩「有没有玩具」。这里建议一句：对给你做饭的人客气点。一个连续做了20个小时汉堡的前科犯是很容易生气的。往面包上打喷嚏、在冰淇淋里吐口水只不过是一下的事情，最后上菜到你面前的可能是咬过的吸管或者是咸得不行的蛋黄酱。
