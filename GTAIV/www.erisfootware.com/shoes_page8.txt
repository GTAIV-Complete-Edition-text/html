;0x0D7E7458=When a young ad exec came up with the cocky suggestion "Why don't we sell air?" in 1991, we sacked him on the spot, stole the idea and designed a shoe with a completely pointless internal inflation mechanism.  The likelihood is that you were still a twinkle in your parents' eye or shitting your pants when the PUMP UP was first released but we are giving a whole new generation the chance to wear the sneaker that defined the 1990s.  The Eris PUMP UP is back with a vengeance in the limited 'Rainbow' edition.  A collaboration between Eris and famous experimental artist Bao - who swallowed and vomited paint over every shoe - each pair of PUMP UPs is a unique collector's item.  Also can be removed and attached to pump up your penis.   Remember the future. Air never goes out of style.
