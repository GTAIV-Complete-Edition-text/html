;0x60EA1DAC=Ever since the days of ancient Rome and Greece, footwear has been a status symbol.  If you can't afford shoes, you are a peasant.  At Eris, we design shoes at many different price points that will define you.  We are producing individuality en masse.  It's not the sneakers; it's the image that the sneakers project.  We sell you sports shoes that you will never use for sport.  We make you feel athletic without breaking a sweat.  We give you an identity.  We put the soul in sole.  Sports are a lifestyle, even if you don't play them.  Look the part. Act like a winner.

;0x9678D532=The question isn't whether you can afford to spend $150 on a pair of plastic shoes.  It's whether you can afford not to. And the answer is 'No'.  Sneakers are important.  Kids kill for them.  People in Asian countries pay thousands for limited editions.  Everybody deserves to be cool.  We all can be. Like cool clones of each other, only individual clones, if that makes any sense, which it doesn't.  Imagine this is a training montage and forget what I just said. Everybody deserves to fit in if they can afford it.
