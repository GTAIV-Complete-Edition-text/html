Pain, I've figured that out.  I know all about it.   My father came this weekend which is another reason why I didn't get a lot of sleep.  What an appetite on that guy.  I have to cover up all my tattoos and pretend that we actually have something in common.  Great.  He got wounded in the war.  Big deal.  I'd love to have another piece of metal in me.  Nothing works in this house.  The VHS player is broken.  I KNOW THERE ARE DVDS STUPID BUT ALL MY COOL SHIT IS ON VHS.  Plus dvds are so, digital.  Analog is so much warmer.  Plus I like the worn aged look.  My job at the print shop is shit.  The $50s I printed look like shit.  And I laminated some black and white pictures of me crying in the meat aisle at the grocery store today.  Bitter art teachers suck, cause she said that it wasn't expressive enough.  What do you want me to do?  Roll around in the meat case?  Death doesn't even phase people anymore.  I have to go drink some more of that wretched black tea I bought at the health food store.  If my probation officer finds out what I did this weekend I'm farked.",

I held him until he went limp in my arms and then threw him in the trash.  Everything I touch seems to die, especially since I've been brewing meth. So many things seem to end in my trembling hands.
