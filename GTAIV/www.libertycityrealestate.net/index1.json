        "original": "Tragedy struck today when members of the Liberty City Union for Construction Workers were gunned down on the site of my Castle Gardens property development.  The idea that workers can strike is an entirely alien concept to me as I have worked hard my whole life and the more cynical amongst us might chalk this catastrophe up to karma.  However, I would like to take this opportunity to offer my heartfelt sympathies and condolences to the families of the victims who died needlessly fighting a futile liberal cause.  Out of respect for the dead, I am not going to use the word corruption but this whole incident reeks of foul play.  What were union officials doing with semi-automatic weapons?  I am confident that the authorities will carry out a full investigation.  In the meantime, I pray for your families to struggle through life knowing this didn't have to happen this way.  Work on the Castle Gardens project has been ceased indefinitely.  I knew I should have listened to my wives and stayed in the Middle East.",
        "translated": "位于Castle Gardens的楼盘工地发生枪击，致使自由城建筑工人工会的成员遇害，这是一场彻头彻尾的悲剧。但我兢兢业业地工作了一辈子，还是头一回听说工人居然可以罢工的。我们当中的利己主义者越多，发生这种悲剧的可能性就越大，甚至还会遭到报应。尽管如此，请允许我向受害者的家属表达由衷的哀悼，感叹自由派的徒劳事业带来的无谓死亡。出于对死者的尊重，我不会说这次事件存在腐败黑幕，但其背后一定存在不正当行为。工会官员拿着半自动武器守在工地里算什么？相信有关部门会对此进行详实深入的调查。同时，对于那些理解事情不必如此，仍在为生活奔波劳累的受害者家属，请允许我为你们献上祝福。Castle Gardens的工地现已无限期关停。我就该听几个老婆的话，待在中东的。",
