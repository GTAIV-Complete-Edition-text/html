;0xA95941FA=We, the undersigned, are deeply concerned for the well-being of James Pedeaston who was wrongfully imprisoned without trial in October 2003. One of the most respected figures in world media, James is a human rights pioneer who has dedicated his life to showing androgynous pre-teen youths in poverty-stricken corners of the globe that there is an alternative to the cycle of oppression and poverty.

;0x7999CBA3=James is currently detained in horrendous conditions in a Bali jail for a crime that he did not commit on purpose this time. If you have never snuggled up with a smooth-buttocked young boy on a lonely winter's night then you have evidently never been to a boarding school. Is it so wrong to want to loosen up with a soapy massage after a hard day pounding the bush? We believe that there has been a heinous miscarriage of justice in the Pedeaston case. Americans are father figures - strong men like to come to Indonesia and take care of boys and girls as if they were their own.

;0xAFB910CB=We appeal to the Indonesian government to drop the charges against James Pedeaston and to release him without delay.

;0x3C4FB8EC=We do not want to bribe the wrong official. Please at least point us in the right direction.

;0x43B83EB9=Sincerely,
