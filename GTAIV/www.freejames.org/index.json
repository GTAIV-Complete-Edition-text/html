Still groggy from the opium he indulged in the night before, James mumbled \"Not now Guntur, how did you manage to slip your leash again?\" before opening his eyes to find a rifle barrel in his mouth and a leering Balinese policeman standing over him. Having spent the last of his Rupiah in a Kuta nightclub the previous evening, James was unable to meet the financial demands required to secure his innocence and was bound, gagged and beaten, bundled into the back of a van and thrown into a dark prison cell.",
        "translated": "2003年10月23日，那是一个和往常一样的平凡早晨。又长又硬的什么东西戳到了James Pedeaston脸上，吵醒了他。昨晚刚抽完大烟，依然头昏脑胀的James咕哝道：「别闹，Guntur，你怎么又弄断链子跑出来了？」。睁开双眼，嘴里却是来福枪的枪管，巴厘岛的警察正站在他的身旁，斜视着他。前一天晚上，James在库塔的夜店里花完了身上的印尼盾，一时掏不出自证清白所需要的资金。于是他被绑了起来，堵住嘴巴，装进面包车，最终来到了黑暗的牢房。",

It is reputed that he had been spotted taking photos in schoolyards, loitering on street corners with bags of candy, hanging out near the local swimming pool with a banana hammock on and offering cigarettes to parents in exchange for their children. These reports are completely unfounded and, apart from some compromising notes and pictures planted/forged by corrupt officials, as yet only circumstantial evidence has come to light.",
