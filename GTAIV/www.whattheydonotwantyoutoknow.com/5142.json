Speed limits and white lines in the middle of the road and all that shit are just there to impede our consciousness and stop us from living our lives. I mean, who the fuck can tell me that this is a one way street or I can't turn fucking left here? Expand your horizons, man. Take off from the street and attain true enlightenment. These are some places I found to jump from the bureaucrats' road makings and get some air. Especially good on high power blotter acid or peyote.",
