It's nice for them to have friends and lovers and slaves.  I watch them do things and sometimes I follow them back to their places and we have fun together there.  Boo Boo Wilkins likes to eat lungs, and hearts and eyes.  She's a hungry little thing.  I look after her.  Getting friends together is sometimes better than going jogging by yourself.  More people = more fun.  Here is where I have found people enjoying themselves together.",
