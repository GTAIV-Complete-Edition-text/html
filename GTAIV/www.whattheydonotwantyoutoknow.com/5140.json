These things are being used by the government to spy on ambitious white collar workers and limit our civil liberties.  I'm an accountant and work in offices all around Algonquin and Alderney.  With these platforms spying on you a man feels nervous about getting a blackmail blowjob from a guilty CFO, taking a large line of Charlie off a desk, or cooking the books.  Be warned: these are the buildings that are being monitored.",
