Infected pigeons are all over the city and it's only a matter of time before it spreads to humans and we're all coughing out our pancreases and pus is pouring out from all our pores.  I've seen 200 diseased pigeons in Liberty.  Is it just a coincidence?  Come on!  Betta pharmaceuticals manufacture a pigeon flu vaccine, diseased pigeons arrive in Liberty City.  Connect the dots!  We're all gonna die just to push the Beta stock price higher on the BAWSAQ.  Someone needs to get rid of the pigeons.  Think of the children!",
