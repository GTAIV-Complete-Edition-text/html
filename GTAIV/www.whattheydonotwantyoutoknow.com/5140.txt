;0x44E42EC8=Is anyone else freaked out by the amount of window cleaning platforms in this city?  Surely the pollution induced acid raid cleans our windows enough?  These things are being used by the government to spy on ambitious white collar workers and limit our civil liberties.  I'm an accountant and work in offices all around Algonquin and Alderney.  With these platforms spying on you a man feels nervous about getting a blackmail blowjob from a guilty CFO, taking a large line of Charlie off a desk, or cooking the books.  Be warned: these are the buildings that are being monitored.

;0x2EA54F0D=I like watching people.  Can you get into people's apartments with these platforms, buddy pal'o'mine?  Do you need a partner for jogging and maybe more?

;0x37DC9CE1=I don't think you can get into peoples' apartments, Eddie.  Sure, jogging sounds good.  It's getting kind of dangerous to jog alone at night. I'll IM you.
