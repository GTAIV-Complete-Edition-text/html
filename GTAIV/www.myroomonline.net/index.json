MyRoom is part of Internet 2.0 - where we make a new Internet that looks shittier than the old one.  MyRoom is a place where creepy old men can set up a fake profile and chat with vulnerable underagers.  MyRoom is a place where every girl claims she's a model and every guy claims he's hung.  MyRoom is a place where everyone wants to be your friend and you're always alone.  MyRoom is like, totally a place where you're and your and it's and its are completely interchangeable. MyRoom is a place where moody teenagers in heavy eyeliner and tight jeans can whine incessantly about the tragedy of their lives.  Forget drugs - MyRoom is the most addictive vice out there.  It starts out as a bit of fun and ends up destroying you.  You sit there obsessively clicking the refresh button, desperate for your fix of messages and friend requests.  You don't sleep, you don't eat.  You just sit in your room, like a hikikomori.",

You browse so many profiles that you start to think that you recognize everybody you pass in the street.  You touch yourself to strangers' personal photos. You set up a second profile so that you can post more comments on your main page.  You have 9,000 friends, all of whom you have never met in person.  It's amazing how popular you can feel sitting alone in a dark room night after night.  Girls might ignore you at school but at least you can cyber-stalk them when you get home using an online alias.  MyRoom isn't just for emos, scenesters, attention whores and sexual predators.  Well, actually, it is, but that's not the point.  We are taking over the world.  Nowadays kids give out their MyRoom address instead of their phone number.  There's only so long you can hold out.  Register today.  Privacy is over.  You're already on here somewhere.",
