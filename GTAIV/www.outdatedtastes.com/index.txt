;0xDF50DE06=In the past ten years, we have gone from a back-street thrift store to a multimillion-dollar vintage clothing business. We take clothes donated to charities and churches and then sell them to posh city kids for hundreds of dollars! Buying second-hand clothes used to be definitive proof that the American dream had passed you by, that you were a turd on the bottom of society's shoe. As a child, there was no greater humiliation than turning up for the first day of school in an older sibling's cast-offs or, even worse, an ill-fitting hand-me-down from your parents. Nowadays, however, thanks to euphemisms like 'retro', 'boho', 'period' and 'pre-loved', it has become the height of hip to rifle through dead people's belongings at flea markets and to walk around in clothes worn by some fogeys who used to sit in front of radios in the living room for entertainment and wash once a month in a communal tub. Suddenly we can sell a bedbug-infested sweater that we found in the trash can for $400 because it is 'vintage 80's Binco'.
0xDF50DE06=过去十年，我们从地下的旧货店变成了营收百万的复古服装企业。我们弄来了捐给慈善机构和教会的衣服，一件几百地卖给城里的时髦小子！购买二手衣物在过去绝对是社会底层的人才会干的事，只有被美国梦抛弃的人才会这么做。一个小孩，上学第一天穿的是哥哥姐姐穿剩下的衣服，实在太丢脸了。当然，还可以更糟，比如说穿的是父母的旧衣服。但是现在，多亏了「怀旧风」「流浪风」「年代风」「复古风」这样的说法，去跳蚤市场收割死人的遗物也变得流行起来。人们在老家伙的衣物中漫步，而衣服主人生前的娱乐只有坐在客厅里听收音机，每个月也只会去公共浴室洗一次澡。突然这些从垃圾桶里翻出来的生着跳蚤的毛衣就值$400了，因为那是「八十年代的复古风格」。

;0x71BC6A33=From hipsters to models to goths to soccer moms to indie scene whores, the streets are full of tragic fashion victims who have paid a fortune to dress in a bunch of musty rags that somebody threw away for good reason 30 years ago. You don't know whether to chuck them a dollar or just to beat the shit out of them for thinking things were so damn lovely in the "good old days." People now talk about clothes in the same way as a fine wine - as if a pair of shitty underpants somehow improves with age - and expensive boutiques have started making their new clothing look like it was worn by a junkie domestic violence victim. It's all about cashing in on the vintage craze. Complete your vintage wardrobe with some of this over-priced crap: 
0x71BC6A33=从嬉皮士到模特，从阴暗哥特到足球妈妈，再到非主流的妓女，马路上全是所谓时尚的悲剧受害者，穿着大价钱买来的发霉破布，殊不知这些衣服30年前就被人扔掉不是没有原因的。看见那些觉得当年的生活更加美好的人，都不知道是该施舍他们一块钱，还是暴揍他们一顿。现在人们开始用评价葡萄酒的方式评价衣服，讲究什么陈年内裤的品质会随时间增长，高端服装品牌也刻意给新衣服做旧，像是被吸毒家暴男撕扯过一样。复古风潮的实质就是赚钱。用这些溢价垃圾填满你的复古衣柜吧：
