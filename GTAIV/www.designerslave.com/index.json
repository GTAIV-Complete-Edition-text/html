        "original": "Designer clothes are more important than politics and religion. They are a proper status symbol. They get you into nightclubs. They get you laid. They can even solve a major crisis. Fashion means that you are thinking for yourself by someone else. Life is too short to worry about tomorrow or yesterday. Worry about 2 seconds ago, which is when most fashion falls out of fashion. Let the media guide you towards individuality. Listen to the magazines and TV shows; they know what they are talking about. Look to teen celebrities for inspiration.",
        "translated": "名牌服饰比政治、宗教更加重要。名牌是身份和地位的象征，能够让你进入夜店，也能让你约到炮，甚至还能帮你化解重大危机。时尚就是让别人替你思考如何打扮。人生苦短，甚至不足以担忧明天或是昨天。还是担心下两秒前吧，大部分潮流在两秒后就过气了。让媒体告诉你什么是个性。听杂志和电视节目的话，他们知道自己在说什么。参考年轻名人寻找灵感。",

        "original": "Designs without enormous logos are not designs. Understatement is a failure in fashion. If you are going to buy a designer item, make sure that it is as gaudy as possible so that everybody knows how much you spent. Big logos impress people. It does not matter if you are too young, too old or too fat. From a 5-year-old in a padded bra to a 50-year-old in a crop-top to a 500-pounder in hot pants, it is the brand that counts. A designer name excuses all fashion felonies. The only crime is a crime against individual choice, but not dressing like everyone else.",
        "translated": "没有巨大LOGO的设计不叫设计。遮遮掩掩是不可能在时尚界成功的。如果要买名牌服饰，一定要选那种张扬到一眼就能看出多贵的。巨大的LOGO能给人留下印象。年纪会不会太老太小，身材会不会太胖，这些都不重要。从穿胸垫胸罩的5岁小孩，到穿着露脐上衣的50岁大妈，再到穿热裤的450斤胖子，牌子才是最重要的。名牌足以掩盖任何穿搭上的罪行。唯一的罪行就是选择自己的风格，而不是和别人打扮相似。",
