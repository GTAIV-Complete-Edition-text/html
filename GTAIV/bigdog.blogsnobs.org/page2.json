Not that I told her of course.  Well, I only told her once.  She's quiet and doesn't speak much English - just my type!  If she doesn't look like someone in an anime movie, I'm not interested. I love them small - it makes me feel so strong and masculine.  She's had a very sheltered upbringing with an overbearing father.  What a result!  None of this \"All you do is talk about yourself stuff\" that I usually get from girls.  Fingers crossed that she returns all my voicemails.",

I keep telling myself that every post I write is better than the last but I never listen.  I'm doomed to be one of those people who can't stop raising the bar.  These aren't just words I'm writing.  They are drops of paint on the fabric of society.  My mouse is my brush.  My 14-inch Panoramic LCD monitor is my easel.  Together they form a canvas of immense depth and perspicacity; a portrait of popular culture that will hang on the walls of the common psyche for generations to come.

There are too many self-important morons out there writing into the void and clogging up the blogosphere with their meaningless drivel like pubes in a shower drain.  To be a successful blogger, you have to use lots of metaphors and believe that your opinion matters.  I have an opinion on everything, like the skin on a dog, at least that's what my ex-girlfriend told me.  She was intellectually inferior to me anyway. We broke up a while ago, when we were 13.  I've gotten over her now.  Most people are inferior to me.  I only want Asian chicks from now on.  They are docile and don't answer back, at least in my fantasies.  And kinky!  I'm not the kind of guy to stereotype but I've watched enough bad animation of underwater lesbian alien ninja bondage orgies with robotic tentacled sea monsters to know, believe me.  Anime rocks my world.  Not to mention my Asian porn collection!  I figured out the other day that I now have enough Japanese erotica to watch schoolgirls for 6 days straight!  Even the names are exotic.  It has nothing to do with ugly white guy asian fetish syndrome or whatever my ex called it.  I just like the idea of a woman in a kimono serving me tea and walking on my back.",

My ability to infer things and then portray them as facts must also play a part.  Some people ask me why I blog or why I have three blogs, one dedicated completely to my fascination with tiny Asian girls that sometimes look like boys. To me that's like asking an artist why he paints or a bird why it flies.  It is part of my very essence.  It is hard-wired into my DNA. I am one of those guys who will sit alone in a caf√© or bar or outside my boss's office, eavesdrop on a conversation and then offer that group of people my unsolicited opinion.  Most of the time they ignore me, hit me or throw drinks, but that's the price you pay when you have a voice and are so fantastic in your 30s. My voice booms out over the blogosphere like a foghorn over the ocean, it's too bad nobody reads my blogs.  I'll have to think of something to change that.  I'm writing so well today that it pains me to stop but those manga figurines aren't going to paint themselves.  Don't worry - I promise to post again very soon.",
