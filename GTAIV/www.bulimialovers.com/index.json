        "original": "The media has done all that it can to bombard us with unrealistic body images, yet we find ourselves in the midst of an obesity epidemic.  Everywhere you look, there are girls waddling down the street with muffin tops spilling out of their jeans.  You can't travel on a plane or train without having to rub thighs with a hideous hulk of sweat and blubber.  Even homeless people are fat nowadays.  It's disgusting.  It's wrong.  Look to your role models on television and in fashion magazines for thinspiration.  There's a reason they're famous.  There's a reason they're photographed.  There's a reason they date hunky heart-throbs.  It's called starving yourself.  Why do you think that the red carpet isn't full of wheezing obeasts?  Why don't you see 300lb supermodels stomping down the runway?  Fatties don't become celebrities (well, apart from the funny ones, but nobody really finds them attractive).  Do you want to be accepted, travel in limos and go to all the best parties, or be one of those whales who lifts up a stomach roll to find a whole ecosystem living under there?  Do you want to be attractive to the opposite sex or limit yourself to being a last resort for ugly drunks at two in the morning?  Do you want to be a hardass or a lardass?  Time to get motivated.  Join the fight.  Perfection starts at 100lbs and under.",
        "translated": "尽管媒体已经倾其所能，用不切实际的骨感画面高强度轰炸社会，但肥胖依然普遍存在。目所能及之处都是摇摇晃晃的姑娘，肚子上的赘肉已经鼓到牛仔裤外面了。坐火车坐飞机的时候，身旁永远是一个满身大汗虎背熊腰的丑陋巨人。就连现在的流浪汉都是胖子了。太恶心了，这样绝对有问题。看看电视和时尚杂志上的榜样，把他们当作你减肥瘦身的动力。他们能出名是有原因的。他们能上镜也是有原因的。他们能约到结实性感的万人迷更是有原因的。那就是饿着自己。你以为为什么红毯上没多少喘着气的胖子？你以为为什么见不到270斤的胖子在T台上走秀？胖子成不了名人(谐星路线除外，但没人会觉得他们性感)。你是想被人认同、专车出行、玩遍派对，还是成为一个肥肉底下满是病菌的巨大怪兽？你是想对异性充满吸引力，还是成为丑陋酒鬼的备胎的备胎？你想要坚硬的翘臀，还是下垂的肉坨？动起来吧，加入战斗。90斤只是完美的最低门槛。",

And you won't need to wear bras anymore - all your body fat will disappear!  You won't need to waste money on tampons - you can kiss your period goodbye!",
        "translated": "还有什么比皮包骨头更加美丽？还有什么比突出的臀骨更加动人？很多人喜欢抚摸你的后背，感受每段脊椎的顿挫。而且以后再也不用穿胸罩了，身上的脂肪全都会消失！更不用在卫生棉上浪费钱了，从此以后还能告别经期！",

We're not telling you to cover yourself in plastic wrap and pound the treadmill for nine hours.  We're not asking you to live on baby carrots, celery and gin.  We love food; so much, in fact, we believe in tasting it twice!  If you feel like locking yourself in your bedroom and wolfing down a bucket of fried chicken, a bowl of cookie batter and five tubs of ice cream, that's awesome.",
        "translated": "不是说你要像那些支持厌食症的狂人一样，瘦成集中营的俘虏。也不是说你要用保鲜膜包裹自己，在跑步机上运动九个小时。更不是说让你只吃小胡萝卜、芹菜和琴酒。我们热爱食物，实际上，我们的信条是品尝两次！如果你想把自己锁在卧室里，狼吞虎咽下一桶炸鸡、一罐黄油曲奇和五个冰淇淋，那就太棒了。",

        "original": "You should be able to eat as much as you want whenever you want and then do the ol' one-finger-purgeroo.  Don't feel guilty about it. Animals in nature regurgitate their food all the time, and people don't persecute them. Not into the finger down the throat?  There are other ways to stay thin.  Drink some olive oil.  Or pop a laxative and flush that cheesecake down the drain.  There's always a way to keep the weight down, or bring it up.  Nobody said that being emaciated was easy.  You have to dedicate time, effort and a lot of visits to the restroom.  Your hair will fall out, your esophagus will tear and the acid will rot your teeth but it will all be worth it when you fit into those size zero jeans.  And just think, no more periods!  Anybody who tells you that you're too skinny is just jealous.  If you really want to put on weight, get a boob job!  Come on - let's see those hips.  Show off that rib cage.  Love yourself to the bones.  Hanging out with Ana is no fun.  Remember, Mia is your friend.  Have some dignity, girls!  Hide your regurgitated food in a plastic bag under the bed.",
        "translated": "随时都可以吃，多少都可以吃，吃完来个经典的手指抠喉咙就行。不要有负罪感。自然界的动物一直都在反刍食物，人类也可以。不喜欢用手抠？总有其他能够瘦身的办法的。喝点橄榄油，也可以直接来点泻药，把芝士蛋糕排到下水道里。无论是想要减肥还是增重，总会有办法的。想要日渐消瘦也不是件容易事，需要你付出大量的时间、精力，多去卫生间。你的头发会脱落，食道会受损，胃酸会腐化你的牙齿。但是只要能穿上XXS码的牛仔裤，这一切都是值得的。再想想从此没有经期！所有说你太瘦了的人都是嫉妒你罢了。如果你真的很想增重，就去隆胸吧！来嘛，看看那些屁股。秀出骨感胸腔。厌食并不好玩。记住，暴食才是你的朋友。塑造自尊吧，姑娘们！用塑料袋装好反刍的食物，藏到床底。",
