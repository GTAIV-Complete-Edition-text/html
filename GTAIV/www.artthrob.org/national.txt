;0x6DE89817=NUCA will be exhibiting a sample of work from Bao, the Chinese artist who is known throughout the world for his innovative abstract paintings, created in collaboration with giant pandas.  Bao shouts, screams, sings and beats the pandas with a gnarly branch, often for hours, until they have completely covered a canvas with paint.  An excerpt translated from his autobiography reads, "Creativity should be raw and animalistic.  We are products of our environment, mere robots programmed to conform to a pre-determined interpretation of the world.  Pandas are untainted by the collective weight of human conscience. I have distilled the essence of what it is to create. I am not the artist, they are the artists, however they can't spend money, so I buy them trinkets to entertain them." 
0x6DE89817=NUCA将展出阿宝的作品。这名中国艺术家与大熊猫合作，绘制出了闻名世界的创新抽象画。阿宝大喊大叫、引吭高歌，边用粗糙的树枝抽打熊猫，直到它们在画布上涂满颜料，这一过程往往要持续几个小时。引用一段他的自传的译文：「创意应该兼具野性和兽性。我们人类是环境的产物，仅仅是提前设定行为、符合世界给定法则的机器人。熊猫则不会被人类良知的集体压迫影响。我已经提炼出了创作的精髓。我不是艺术家，大熊猫才是艺术家，但它们花不了钱，所以才需要我替它们买些小玩具。」

;0xAF8C617C=The latest exhibition at NUCA is a series of photographs from the British homosexuals, Simon & Nigel. Simon & Nigel have shaken up the art world in recent years with their controversial reenactments of pivotal events in history, dressed as gorillas.

;0x9BCE3C01=We are condemned to view the past through the eyes of others and these photos act as a powerful reminder of the subjectivity inherent in all historical accounts. From the Fall of Troy to Hiroshima to the Rwandan Genocide, Simon & Nigel's work encourages us to approach history from a fresh perspective, stripped of prejudice and stereotypes. Once you see Hitler dressed as a gorilla, it will explain WWII in a way you never thought possible. 
0x9BCE3C01=我们注定要通过他人的视角回顾过去，而这些照片强有力地提醒了我们，所有历史记录都存在其主观性。从特洛伊的陷落到广岛原子弹，再到卢旺达种族大屠杀，Simon & Nigel的作品鼓励我们撇去偏见和成见，以一个全新的角度看待历史。看看那个打扮成希特勒的大猩猩，它将以一种未曾设想的方式解释二战。

;0xA075A9FD=Critical commentary: "Simon & Nigel shock. They simplify history to the most base concepts. It is work about mortality and seeing theirs will make you give thanks for your own mortality."
0xA075A9FD=点评：「Simon & Nigel震撼了世界。历史被他们简化为最基本的概念。这是关于短暂人生的杰作，看了他们的作品，你就会为人生短暂而庆幸。」
