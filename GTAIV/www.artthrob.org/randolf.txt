;0x0A3C2658=An exhibition of the work of the Aesthetic Minimalist, Philips Van Der Philip.  The Dutchman has been widely praised for making the subject matter of his paintings as unrecognizable as possible.  Van Der Philip's blank canvas, entitled 'Nothing', sold to a private collector last year for $120 million and has been described by critics as "a metaphor for the nihilistic decadence of modern society."

;0xE3C4B027=Life is about math, and nothing runs your brain in circles like trying to wrap your head around the concept of pi.  Adam Biggs has made his life's work the circle.  A selection of paintings from the world-renowned artist, Adam Biggs, will be on display at the Randolf Art Center for the next month.  Biggs achieved cult-like status for his paintings of circles during the 1950's and 1960's and is considered to be the father of the Abstract Literalist movement.  In one of his rare interviews, Biggs explained that, "A circle, by its very nature, is perfect and the quest of every artist should be to strive for circles, the mystery of what's on the other side of that circle.  A whole theme park exists to this concept.  If I try to paint a picture of a bird that is as true to reality as possible and it dies, it will inevitably be imperfect.  If I paint the bird as a circle, however, it takes on a perfect ring of fire in the loins of my soul." 
0xE3C4B027=人生离不开数学，但很少有东西能把你绕在圆周率上，让你晕头转向。Adam Biggs将其毕生精力都投入到了画圆当中。Randolf艺术中心将在下个月展出这位世界知名艺术家的部分画作。上世纪五六十年代，Biggs凭借画圆获得了邪教教主般的崇拜，并被誉为抽象白描主义之父。在他少有的一次采访中，Biggs解释道：「究其本质，圆是完美的。每个艺术家都应该竭尽全力地追求圆，追求圆彼岸的谜团。甚至可以根据这一理念专门建造一个主题公园。如果我极尽真实地去描绘一只鸟，然后这只鸟死了，那么不可避免地，这幅作品就变得不完美了。但，如果我把鸟画成一个圆，它就会在我灵魂的胯下形成一个完美的火环。」

0x747BEDF5=点评：「Biggs很有魅力，他对我们大多数人都不理解的概念进行了非常敏感的探索。但从作品中可以看出，他也不理解这些概念。这就是深奥的地方了。」
