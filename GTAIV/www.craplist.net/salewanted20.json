They normally let me check my email in TW@, if I'm not too wasted, so send me a note if you want some easy cash.  Ideally, you should live in or near Central Algonquin.  One other thing - I'll need to smoke in there.  Can we start tonight?  I'm fed up with drunken college students pissing on me and cops beating me up.",
        "translated": "10块一晚？0-7点？在偷到更多信用卡凑够钱之前，我要找一个热乎点的地方歇脚。只要我没喝醉，TW@网吧一般肯让我上机看邮箱，想赚点小钱的话就邮件联系吧。最好你就住在Algonquin中部附近。哦对了，我会在车里抽烟的。今晚能入住吗？我受够了被喝醉的大学生尿一身和挨警察揍了。",
