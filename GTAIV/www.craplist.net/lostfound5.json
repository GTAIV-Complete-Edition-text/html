        "original": "My husband and I found a bachelor in our front yard this morning.  He is handcuffed, dressed as a French maid and has GROOM written across his forehead in lipstick.  He seems very disoriented.  What did you do to him????  All he has said so far is \"It was a dude\".  Please come to collect him.  My in-laws arrive in a couple of hours.  Let's hope his eyebrows grow back before the wedding.",
        "translated": "我和丈夫今早在门口院子里找到了一个学士。他铐着手铐，穿着女仆装，脑门上用口红写着GROOM (译注：可作新郎、男仆解释)。他好像有点神志不清。你对他做了什么啊？？？？他只说了一句「是那哥们」。请你过来接他。过几个小时我的公公婆婆就要来我家了。希望他的眉毛能在婚礼前长出来。",
