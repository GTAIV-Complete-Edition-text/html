        "original": "My isolation bunker is finished!  It is a cozy but functional space: bedroom, living room, bathroom (with rudimentary plumbing), blast ceiling, Geiger counter, and a masturbatorium.  I have board games, a record player and enough instant noodles to last three years (which should be long enough, by my calculations).  It has its own water well and small solar-powered generator, cleverly disguised as a bird table.  I've done the best I can with the time available to me.  Oh, and we recycle human waste.",
        "translated": "我的堡垒基地完工了！麻雀虽小五脏俱全：卧室、客厅、浴室(有供水设施)、炫酷的天花板、盖格计数器，还有一间自慰室。我有很多桌游、一台唱片机，以及足够撑上三年的方便面(据我计算，三年应该够长了)。堡垒里还有水井和小型太阳能发电机，太阳能板巧妙的伪装成了喂鸟器。已经是在我有限的时间里能达到的最高水平了。噢，还有一个排泄物再生系统。",

Some air freshener might be a good idea.  I'm leaving my wife behind so I need at least one woman of child-bearing age.  Save yourselves.  They are coming.  We haven't got long.  I am battening down the hatches at 11:06 tomorrow morning.",
