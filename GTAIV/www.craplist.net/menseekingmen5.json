        "original": "I've made it 3 weeks off the sauce but I'm at the end of the line.  It's boring.  Morning, afternoon, evening - they're all the same.  I can't find anything fun to do.  There are only so many times I can go to the movies.  I miss all my drunk friends.  Sober people only talk about goals and exercise and salad.  Even cigarettes don't taste the same.  And how am I supposed to pick up women?  Fuck what the doctor says - I'm going back on the booze and I want to fall off the wagon in style.  I'm looking for somebody to join me in the most self-loathing display of binge drinking Dukes has ever seen, starting tonight.  Anybody will do - you're just a decoy so it looks like I'm not drinking alone.  I'm 32 y/o and go at it real hard.",
        "translated": "戒了三周酒，我真的受不了了。太无聊了。早上、下午、晚上，没有任何区别。人生毫无乐趣。去看电影的机会也不是随时都有。我好想那些酒鬼朋友啊，清醒的人只会谈奋斗、谈锻炼、谈沙拉。戒酒后连抽烟都没味道了。这还怎么泡妞啊？去他妈的医嘱，老子要喝酒，轰轰烈烈地破戒。今晚来一个人陪我喝酒，到时候一定是全Dukes最自暴自弃的豪饮场面。谁都可以，陪我坐着就行，看着总比我一个人喝闷酒强。我今年32了，过得很累。",
