;0x177B26F3=I've been trying to think of ways to spice up my life.  I'm 35 years old, happily married with two kids and I have a good job in insurance.  But something's missing.  I feel like I'm old before my time.  I need to inject some excitement into my daily routine through my arm before it's too late.  I need a challenge, something to get the adrenaline pumping again.  An addiction would be nice, but, in short, I need a nemesis.  I'm willing to pay $1200 up front for your services as an arch enemy over the next six months.  Nothing crazy.  Steal my parking space, knock my coffee over, trip me up when I'm running for the subway and occasionally whisper in my ear "Ahha, we meet again".  That kind of thing.  Just keep me on my toes.  Complacency will be the death of me.  You need to have an evil streak and be blessed with innate guile and cunning.  You should also be adept at inconspicuous pursuit.  Evil laugh preferred.  Send me a note with picture and a brief explanation of why you would be a good nemesis.
