;0x284B69DA=I give up.  I've already lost 30 hours of my life and it's just not worth it.  I bought the new Shoddi bed from Krapea last week but I can't put it together!!!!  I knew it was too good to be true for $20!  I'm pretty sure that most of the parts are the wrong size or missing but it is difficult to tell from the pictorial assembly instructions.  I feel like such an idiot but I can't take it any more.  Life's too short and I feel like I'm losing my mind.  I tried getting help on  
0x284B69DA=放弃了。我浪费了30个小时的人生，太不值得了。上周我从宜室买了张新的Shoddi床，但怎么都装不好！！！！就知道花20块买来的床不是什么好东西！我敢肯定，那些散件不是尺寸不对就是少了几个，但对着组装说明图很难看出来。我都要怀疑自己的智商了，真忍不了了。人生苦短，我快被折腾疯了。我也试过找

;0x70A62177=  but that bitch Astrid kept telling me that they do not accept returns or exchanges if the box has been opened.  I want all this bamboo-effect plastic out of my house. 
0x70A62177=咨询售后，但那个婊子Astrid只会说开箱之后不能退货换货。我不想在家里见到这张竹子纹理的塑料床了。
