;0xDD46DDA2=I've made it 3 weeks off the sauce but I'm at the end of the line.  It's boring.  Morning, afternoon, evening - they're all the same.  I can't find anything fun to do.  There are only so many times I can go to the movies.  I miss all my drunk friends.  Sober people only talk about goals and exercise and salad.  Even cigarettes don't taste the same.  And how am I supposed to pick up women?  Fuck what the doctor says - I'm going back on the booze and I want to fall off the wagon in style.  I'm looking for somebody to join me in the most self-loathing display of binge drinking Dukes has ever seen, starting tonight.  Anybody will do - you're just a decoy so it looks like I'm not drinking alone.  I'm 32 y/o and go at it real hard.
