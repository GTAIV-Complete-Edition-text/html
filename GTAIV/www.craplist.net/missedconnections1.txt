;0x27E47DAB=Cluckin' Bell, Hove Beach, 8:30 this morning.  You: bearded hobo drinking mouthwash and eating out of the trash can.  Me:  young, blonde student in denim skirt and red blouse.  On my way to the exit, you rolled out from under a table, thrust your hand between my legs and said something about how I knew I wanted it.  Your gesture of chivalry caught me off guard so I must apologize for kicking you in the face.  Very rude of me.  Much as I am attracted to men who don't pull their trousers down to pee, forgive me if I pass on your kind offer this time.
