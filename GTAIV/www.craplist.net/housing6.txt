;0x8201D6BC=Ever since my husband left me for that fakebaked slut of a waitress, money has been tight.  Apparently, some chain-smoking skank who takes it up the can more often than she cleans her teeth is more important to him than his wife of 19 years and two children.  So I have decided to take in a lodger.  We installed a panic room in our house after a break-in about 3 years ago.  I go in there occasionally to spy on my daughter and her boyfriend or to scream at the top of my voice but, like my ex, most of the time it's a waste of space.  I figure that, on the rare occasion there is an intruder, you won't mind me joining you in there.  The room is about 7x7ft and comes complete with separate phone line, internet connection, water supply, first aid kit, fold-out bed, blankets, 3 days of dried food, an assault rifle, copies of German literature, a coloring book of funerals, and an old but functional commode.  There's no natural light but it's very quiet.  The door is made of reinforced steel and has 6 deadbolts.  It's a little soulless at the moment but think of it as a blank canvas on which to stamp your personality.  Shoot me a note if you would like to take a look at the room.  I'm not going to lie to you.  I'm a sour, resentful woman with a deep mistrust of all around me but I've got great legs and I love to drink.  I'm sure that we can make this work. 
0x8201D6BC=自从丈夫抛弃我，和那个美黑过的婊子服务员好上以后，我就很缺钱。显然，对他来说，这个被爆菊的次数比刷牙还多的娘们比他娶了19年的老婆和两个孩子更加重要。所以最后我决定找一个房客。三年前的一次入室抢劫后，我们就在家里布置了一个避难室。我时不时会进去监视我女儿和她男友，或者进去大吼大叫发泄。但是，就和我的前夫一样，这个房间大部分时候都没有用。因为很少会有人入室抢劫，我想就找个房客进去住吧。房间大约有4平米出头，有独立的电话线、网络、供水、急救包、折叠床、毯子、三天份的干粮、一把突击步枪、德国文学的书、葬礼的画册，以及一个老旧但还能用的马桶。房间没有光照，但是很安静。房门是厚铁板的，有6把锁。现在还没什么生气，但你可以当它是一张空白的画布，用你的个性去填补。想要看房就给我发个消息吧。我不会骗你的。我是一个满腹牢骚的女人，对身边人都不信任，但我喜欢喝酒，而且腿很好看。我们一定能成的。
