;0xD8CBE1B3=I bought a load of granola bars, broccoli, figs, lentils and soy milk last week.  Man, was that a mistake.  They say you don't know until you've tried something.  Well, I've tried it and all I know is it tastes like shit and I prefer smoking cigs and drinking Jakeys.  I wouldn't wish that stuff on my worst enemy.  I don't care what that doctor says.  Fucking scaremonger!  Who does he think he is telling me I'll be dead by 40?  I'm 39 and feeling awesome.   My buddy Kev says that doctors get paid commission by the health food companies.  Well, I've got better things to spend my welfare on.  Have you seen how expensive all that rabbit food is?  What a fucking ripoff!  I can eat like a king at Wigwam Burger for $5 a day.  If you're in East Holland, please swing by and take this crap off my hands.  I don't want any money.  I just want it out of my place - it's fucking with my buzz.
