;0x79CA5C47=I'm such a loser at lawbreaking!  Who'd have thought that a life of crime would be so difficult?  Something always seems to go wrong.  I lock the keys in the getaway car.  I burglarize a house and I fall asleep.  I hold up a gas station and leave my wallet on the counter.  I always get so flustered!  I wasn't brought up to be a quitter but, if I botch another job, I'm going to end up doing some serious time.  The judge actually laughed at me when I was last in court.  Can anybody help me out?  I feel like a few pointers from a professional would really boost my confidence.  I'm just looking to shadow you for a couple of weeks and learn a few tricks of the trade along the way.  You should have at least 10 years' experience with a focus on break-ins and stick-ups.  I can't pay you very much but you can keep 100% of takings until I get up to speed.
