;0xB491209C=Just when you think men can't sink any lower, they always find a way to plummet to new depths.  I thought that I'd found the man of my dreams - good-looking, funny, successful, considerate, not too many stab wounds... even my heartless bitch of a mother told me I was marrying up and that's the closest she's ever come to paying me a compliment.  Then Mr. Perfect screwed a slut at his bachelor party and gave me an STD.  Never trust a guy who irons his underwear.  Needless to say, the wedding's been cancelled and I'm on massively expensive drugs for the rest of my life.  If that fucker thinks he's going on the honeymoon, he's got another thing coming.  I don't care if he paid for it.  He's going to be paying for what he did for the rest of his miserable life.  We all make mistakes but riding a stripper bareback and giving your fiancée a STD does not fall into the 'forgivable' category.  The little worm even tried to turn it back on me!  Who the fuck does he think he is????  It's been weeks since I last slept with anybody else and I always make them pull out.

;0x5DC5332F=So who wants to join me on an all-expense paid trip to Jamaica, leaving tomorrow?  My plan is to party hard and run up thousands of dollars on the bastard's credit card.  You must be aged 20-25, hung like a racehorse and god-like in appearance.  I want to send him filthy photos of us on a daily basis.  Email me with a full bio and LOTS of pics!  Not just that one photo that, by a freak combination of camera angle and lighting, makes you look like a model.  We all have one of those.
