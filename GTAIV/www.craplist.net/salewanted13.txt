;0xCEF53CD2=I'll be selling my ex-girlfriend and her stuff this Saturday morning from about 10 AM.  Clothes, shoes, cds, make-up, bubble bath, hairdryers, chicklit and all the other girly trash she filled my apartment with before blowing my best friend in the restroom at Club Liberty.  Pass by, if you've got time.  I've got her tied to a pole in the basement and you can take turns.  I'll be drinking heavily so we can have some fun.  Anything that doesn't go will be burnt at the end of day.
