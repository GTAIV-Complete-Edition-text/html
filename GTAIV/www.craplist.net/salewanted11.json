I knew it was too good to be true for $20!  I'm pretty sure that most of the parts are the wrong size or missing but it is difficult to tell from the pictorial assembly instructions.  I feel like such an idiot but I can't take it any more.  Life's too short and I feel like I'm losing my mind.  I tried getting help on",
