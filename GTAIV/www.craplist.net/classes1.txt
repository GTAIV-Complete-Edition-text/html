;0xCEC2CCB0=Isn't it about time you learned a vitally important, constructed, international, auxiliary language?  Esperanto is spoken by hundreds of people at specially-convened conferences every year.  It's like that watch company that tried to change how time works. Or Greenwich Mean Time.  Who gives a damn what time it is in Greenwich?  Imagine being able to speak to a smattering of academics from all over the world with a single language!  Forget English!  Esperanto is the universal second language of the future.  Who cares that it's harder to learn than Basque and about as romantic as a pre-nuptial agreement?  Give yourself a head-start in life.  Learn Esperanto at our language school in Broker.  Classes start a week from Monday.
