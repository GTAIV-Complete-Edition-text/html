;0x79D54F47=I've been running my mouth at work about this great chick I've been dating.  Just a couple of stories to impress the guys around the water cooler and to deflect any questions about the way I walk. It's not like I'm going to tell them I get stoned and talk to young boys in internet chatrooms every night.  But I forgot about the office party!  I can't believe I was so stupid!  Now all I keep hearing is "I can't wait to meet Mimi", "Is Mimi going to wear the stockings?"  My boss is even talking about inviting us out to his summer house!  I'm in too deep to back out now.  I URGENTLY need a fake Mimi for this Friday night.  As far I can remember, you're a Japanese corporate lawyer with bleached blonde hair and killer legs (mid 20s).  The first night we met, you took me back to your place and covered me in rabbit droppings.  You like to give me head on public buses.  You got your breasts enlarged for my birthday.  You strip for me most evenings and crawl across the floor chanting emo lyrics.  You often turn up at my doorstep dressed as a schoolgirl.  You pole-danced to pay your way through law school.  You're very needy and lean on me heavily for support.  You're double-jointed and cry during movies.  You love me but I'm just using you for sex.  Oh, and you think that I'm really funny.  That's all I can think of for now but I will brief you further on Friday.  I'm up for a promotion this year so I have to make this work.  I need somebody who can pull off cute, intelligent and slutty at the same time.  All you need to do is play the part for a few hours and then I'll kill you off in a fictional car crash over the weekend.   The party is in the Celtica hotel at 7.30pm.
