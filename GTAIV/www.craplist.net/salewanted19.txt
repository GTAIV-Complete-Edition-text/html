;0x75EE6A69=I'm about as deep and insightful a guy as you'll ever meet.  My wife hates the fact I'm always right!  She also hates our swinging parties, but I love them.   I view the world with an extremely critical eye and I have opinions on pretty much everything.  My work gives me a unique opportunity to study society in minute detail - I like to describe myself as the mailman who pushes the philosophical envelope!  Would you like a piece of my mind?  I can send you pearls of wisdom over the course of your day by either text or email.  Things like "one man's happiness is another man's misery" (just came up with that one!).  Think of it like word-of-the-day toilet paper for the electronic age.  Just $1 a pearl!  That's cheaper than a sex line. Come on!  Knowledge is power, people!  I need friends who want my wisdom.
