        "original": "I'm such a loser at lawbreaking!  Who'd have thought that a life of crime would be so difficult?  Something always seems to go wrong.  I lock the keys in the getaway car.  I burglarize a house and I fall asleep.  I hold up a gas station and leave my wallet on the counter.  I always get so flustered!  I wasn't brought up to be a quitter but, if I botch another job, I'm going to end up doing some serious time.  The judge actually laughed at me when I was last in court.  Can anybody help me out?  I feel like a few pointers from a professional would really boost my confidence.  I'm just looking to shadow you for a couple of weeks and learn a few tricks of the trade along the way.  You should have at least 10 years' experience with a focus on break-ins and stick-ups.  I can't pay you very much but you can keep 100% of takings until I get up to speed.",
        "translated": "我连犯法的事都干不好！谁能想到犯个罪都这么困难呢？每次都会在哪里搞砸。准备了逃跑用车，钥匙锁车里了。溜进别人家里，躺床上睡着了。抢了个加油站，钱包落人家柜台上了。每次都手忙脚乱！我也不想半途而废，但是一旦再搞砸一次，我就要坐大牢了。上次上法庭的时候我还被法官嘲笑了。有人能帮忙吗？哪位高手肯指点一二的话，我应该会更有信心一点。我会跟着你学几个星期，了解一下这行的技巧。要求你有10年以上的盗窃抢劫经验。我掏不出多少钱，但是上道之前你可以收着我得手的所有赃物。",
