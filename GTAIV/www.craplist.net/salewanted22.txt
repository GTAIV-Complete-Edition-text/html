;0x3F1D7871=I'll never be able to walk into the golf club without somebody saying "Howdy cowboy" again.  A 52-year-old man in leather pants!  What was I thinking?!!!  Trying to impress that shop assistant!  She was younger than my daughter.  I can't believe I fell for the sales patter - I looked ridiculous.  I couldn't even get up a flight of stairs!  I haven't seen my wife laugh like that for years, especially when I put my back out trying to get them off.  I want to put this behind me.  36 waist, $50.
