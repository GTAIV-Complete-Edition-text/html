;0x0D1D097C=Ever since Mayor Ochoa's crackdown on crime in Liberty City, my precinct has been handing out some aggressive arrest targets.  It's a nightmare.  I didn't sign up for all the dangerous stuff.  I'm more of a man about town - a people person.  I give directions to tourists, I ask hobos not to eat out of the trashcans, I let children play with my gun.  I've got no chance of catching some young punk with half of Colombia coursing through his veins.  It takes me all my time to get up a flight of stairs.  I'm consistently the worst-performing officer in my squad and, if I don't take drastic action, I'll be working security at Binco by the end of the year.
0x0D1D097C=自打Ochoa市长严打自由城的犯罪以后，我的警区就都是一些威胁很大的目标。太可怕了。我可不是为了这些危险的家伙才上岗的。我其实是一个关心城市大家的人——人民公仆。给游客指路解惑，让流浪汉别吃垃圾，把配枪借给孩子们玩。我绝对抓不到那种肚子里有半个哥伦比亚的毒品的小混混，光是上个楼梯就够费劲了。我一直是警队里绩效最差的那个，再拿不出什么成绩的话，恐怕年底就要去宾克服饰当保安了。

;0xF847AE17=So here's the plan.  I need one old lady (the frailer the better) and one mean-looking motherfucker.  Meet me in the middle of Star Junction at 7 PM on Thursday night (I'll be the obese guy in police uniform) so we can synchronize watches and all that jazz.  At precisely 7:49, the mean-looking motherfucker will attack the old lady as she walks past Drusillas restaurant in Little Italy and steal her handbag.  There will be a bit of a struggle (nothing too rough, just slap her around a bit).  At 7:50, I will turn the corner, yell "Stop, Police" and give chase.  Do NOT run too fast.  If you hear me shout "You'll never get away from me", that is your signal to slow down.  After a couple of blocks - actually, make it one block - I will tackle you to the floor and wrestle the handbag from your hands.  Now for the complicated part.  Obviously, you don't want to get arrested.  But I need a very good reason to let you go.
0xF847AE17=计划是这样的。需要一个老妇人(越体弱越好)和一个看上去就不好惹的刺头。周四晚上7点在Star Junction的中间碰头(我是那个穿警服的胖子)，一起对个表，再确认一次具体安排。7:49，老夫人经过小意大利的Drusilla's餐馆，刺头就袭击老夫人，抢走她的包。需要有一个争抢的过程(不用太猛，拍她两下就行了)。7:50，我会从街角出来，大喊「警察，不许动！」然后开始追你。你别跑太快。听见我喊「今天你别想跑」的时候，你就该减速了。过几个街区(算了，一个就够了)，我会把你扑倒在地，抢回老妇人的包。接下来就是最复杂的部分了。你肯定不想真的被捕，但我不能轻易放你走人。

;0x73B98D2A=So, as we are grappling on the floor, I will stab myself in the stomach with a small penknife.  There will be lots of people around so this needs to be done EXTREMELY subtly.  I will talk you through it at the time.  Once I give the word, you will escape and the bloodied hero will stagger back and return the handbag to the old lady!  It's a plan perfect in its simplicity.  I'll be all over the local news and I've got a good chance of making sergeant.
0x73B98D2A=到时候周围肯定有很多人，所以这一步需要十万分的巧妙。到时候我会给你信号，让你跑了你就跑。然后我这个浴血奋战的大英雄再拖着身子把包交还给老妇人！这是一个简单又完美的计划。我一定能登上本地新闻的头条，到时候就有机会升警长了。

;0x78BC5DB4=Who's in?  I can pay you $30 each and take care of any outstanding parking tickets. 
0x78BC5DB4=谁来演？一个人我给$30，还可以帮你消掉停车罚单。
