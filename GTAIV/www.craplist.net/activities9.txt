;0x699B85CB=Are you part of the open source movement?  I want to hear from any Eunux users in the Rotterdam Hill area.  The best operating system in the world!  Who wants to meet up at my place on Saturday nights?  We can recompile a kernel and then watch some porn.  I have a load of energy drinks and my mom is going to make pancakes.  I am interested in learning more about Knobbix 136.7.   Let's talk source code!  L33t!!
