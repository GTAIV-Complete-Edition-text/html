;0xC9FB6932=It's Sunday morning.  You feel like shit.  You wake up on the kitchen floor.  White crusty shit is on your face.  You have a black eye.  You don't remember anything but you KNOW you disgraced yourself.  You're pretty sure you took your cock out.  You're jittery, you're paranoid.  You cancel all your credit cards.  You check your phone and see outbound calls to your ex-girlfriend and boss in the early hours of the morning.  Every cigarette you smoke makes you feel like you just ate it.  None of your friends are answering their cells.  A sense of guilt and shame washes over you.  WHAT THE FUCK DID I DO??!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
0xC9FB6932=周日早上了，而你感觉很糟。你在厨房的地板上醒来，脸上是一块块的白斑，眼睛上是黑的一圈。脑子里一片空白，但你知道，一定又出洋相了。你很清楚自己掏出过鸡巴。你很紧张，你很多疑。你取消了自己所有的信用卡。你拿出了手机，看着几小时前打给前女友和老板的通话记录。嘴里抽的烟像是咽到了肚子里一样。朋友全都不接电话。浑身上下都是负罪感和羞耻感。我他妈做了啥啊？？！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！！

;0x35AE5DF8=Don't worry - you're not alone.  Every weekend there are thousands of people in Liberty City feeling just as terrified and humiliated as you are.  We need to lean on one another and help each other piece the evening back together. Don't sit in your underwear and fear the worst.  Our brunch meet-ups are guaranteed to get you back on track.  Share your drunken tales of woe with people who truly understand your need for reassurance.  Tell us all how you're never drinking again and then get talked into some Bloody Marys.  Most of the time, it's never as bad as you think.   And even if it is, there's always booze! 
0x35AE5DF8=别担心，你不是一个人。自由城的每个周末都有成千上万的人酒鬼和你一样糟糕。我们互相依靠，帮助别人拼凑出平静的心态。向真正理解你的人分享自己喝醉的经历，他们都会给你安慰。告诉我们以后再也不喝了，然后接着聊几句血腥玛丽。大部分时候，其实都没有想象的那么糟。就算真的很糟，有酒那都不是事儿！
