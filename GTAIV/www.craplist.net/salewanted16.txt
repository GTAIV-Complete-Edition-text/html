;0x1B2EF764=Is your neighborhood infested with mangy strays?  Is the novelty of your pet wearing off?  I love cats more than people and currently have over 50 in my house with room for more.  They keep me on my toes, let me tell you, especially when they crap on the kitchen table and take turns peeing on my couches.  But they are my little darlings.  Animals are better companionship than men -- I learned that shortly after high school.  I lived with my mom until she died and she's still upstairs.  My little babies keep her warm.
