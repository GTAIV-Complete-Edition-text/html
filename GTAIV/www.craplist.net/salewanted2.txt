;0x4B02AD79=I've got to get rid of this bed.  Don't get me wrong - it's a great piece of furniture: sturdy frame, memory foam mattress, mahogany headboard.  I was so excited when I bought it.  I couldn't wait to put it through its paces with the first drunken college chick I could find.  Then it happened.  My mojo was gone.  I haven't had any action for over 6 months!  Not a sniff.  My game has completely fallen apart.  I've crashed and burned more times than Samantha Muldoon's career.  Even fat chicks have been passing me up!  Why did I throw my smelly old futon into the river?!!  It can't be a coincidence.  That bed is jinxed.
