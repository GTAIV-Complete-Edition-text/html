;0x4AEE8EB1=Has anybody lost a fat baby?  I found one in the parking lot of the Bohan Burger Shot this morning.  What the fuck have you been feeding that thing?  Butter?  I nearly put my back out hurling it into the pick-up.  It took me about 10 minutes to find out whether it was a boy or a girl!  I don't know whether you forgot it or dumped it (I wouldn't blame you - I'd do the same if my kid looked like that) but, if I haven't heard from anyone by tomorrow at lunchtime, I'm going to sell it to that
