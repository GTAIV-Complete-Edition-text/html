;0x3D5D2F8C=Blonde girl, mini skirt, knee boots, red tee.  You were crossing Traeger Road in Port Tudor last Friday morning.  You had a folder under your arm and looked in a rush.  I was the guy with the ponytail who whistled and shouted 'yeah baby'.  You turned and looked like you were about to shout something back when an Uder Milken truck knocked you about six feet in the air.  I waited with you until the ambulance arrived.  As you slipped out of consciousness, I'm sure that you winked at me.  Fate works in mysterious ways.  Drop me a line if you see this.  Hope that you're back on your feet soon.
