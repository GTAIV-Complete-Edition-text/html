;0xACE631A9=Are you ready for some sensory deprivation?  Make your alone time really alone with this state-of-the-art isolation tank.  Just fill it with salt water, blaze a joint and cut yourself off from the outside world.  Nothing frees your mind more than floating in a sound-proofed box for a couple of hours.  I'll be sad to see it go but I feel like I've discovered more than enough about my true self and that involves floating in my urine in the dark.  I'm ready to move into something a little more sadomasochistic.  This is a bargain at $500.  Send me a note if you want to try it out.
