I've got a bottle of Ragga Rum and about three grams of yay so we can really tear it up.  Send me a short email with photo - you need to look the part.  You know the drill - jewelry, tight jeans, leisure blazer and very well-manscaped facial hair.  I don't want anybody who's going to cramp my style.  If you don't tan, don't waste my time.  Let's see if we can get some Euro-trash tail.",
