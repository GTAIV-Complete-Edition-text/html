;0x56EE737E=It happens to all great bloggers at some point in their lives.  The fountain of creativity dries up. Six days after I started it, my blog has lain idle, frozen in time, left to drift the online seas like a ship without a captain.  SHIT!!!!!  You see what I mean!  Even my metaphors aren't working and nobody does metaphor like me.  I can't disappoint my fans.  It crushes me to think of them sitting there forlornly clicking the refresh button, desperate for some kind of update.  I don't know what's wrong with me.  I've got an amusing incident from the grocery store and a great rant about microwaves that I just can't articulate.  I'm like a summer flower that... oh, fuck it, it's just not happening!!  I have come to the conclusion that the only solution is to find a muse.  BLOGS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT and I need to tell you about every moment I have!  If you're an attractive female with some free time over the next couple of weeks, please send me an email.  Your main task as a muse will be to big me up and marvel at my genius.  $50 per day.
