;0xA42D0A2C=I've just cleaned out my basement.  Finally!  I never thought I'd get round to dumping all that shit in the park.  It turns out there's quite a decent space down there.  About 10x8x20.  I'm willing to rent it out for $200 a week, no questions asked.  I don't care what you put down there, so long as it doesn't smell or corrode my record collection.  It's a nice neighborhood and I'm a cop so this is as low-profile as it gets.  First come, first served.
