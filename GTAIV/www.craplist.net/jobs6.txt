;0x2CE0C671=Time certainly flies when you're having fun!  What's happened to the six months?  These exams have really crept up on me.  I could start studying now but, let's face it, I'll never learn four years of biochemistry in two weeks and there are a ton of parties going down.  I'm a petite (5'2"), curvy white girl with long brown hair and a great sphincter.  I've only been to two lectures this year so it's unlikely any of the professors will even remember what I look like.  A pair of sunglasses and we can easily pull this off.  If I flip the rest of that dope this weekend, I should be able to pay you around $1,000 for your services.  Not bad for three days work!   Send me your resume (with photo) and a copy of your degree certificate.
