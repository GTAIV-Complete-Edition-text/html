If you keep hiding it from your friends and family, it will eventually destroy you.  Society won't change until you stand up and are counted.  Join our support group on Tuesday nights and meet lots of other men just like you.  At the end of each session, we run through some choreographed routines from your favorite bands (don't try to kid us that you don't know them all!).  It's all about learning to accept who you are.  Hold your head up high!",
