        "original": "Craplist was started in San Fierro in 1995 by some basement dwelling sociopaths with the simple mission of creating a computer-based online forum where users can sell stolen bicycles and meet up at lunch time to give a stranger head. Sure, you can find a new apartment or job on this website, but our main goal is to provide knobheaded computer slobs a nationwide distribution platform, and to become the legitimate face of prostitution.  We pride ourselves on bringing perverts and psychos together with desperate individuals who will do anything for money or attention.  You might have to lie, you might have to pay; but anybody can get laid on Craplist.  Capitalists don't understand us.  Newspapers hate us.  Stalkers love us.  Craplist is here to stay. We are you.",
        "translated": "1995年的圣辉洛，几名蜗居地下室的反社会者建立了Craplist。他们最初的想法十分简单：创造一个可以销赃自行车、约网友面基的网络论坛。的确，本站也有招聘求职和租房买房的帖子，但我们的首要目标还是为死脑筋的电脑懒汉提供一个全国性的分发平台，并为皮肉交易套上正当外壳。能为变态色魔、疯子狂人和为了发财出名不择手段的人牵线搭桥是我们的自豪。或靠骗，或靠钱，最终每个人都能在Craplist约到炮。资本家觉得我们不可理喻，新闻报社对我们深恶痛绝，尾行痴汉与我们一见如故。Craplist永远都在，我们都是你的同类。",
