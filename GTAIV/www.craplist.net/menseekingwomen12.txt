;0x2F5023CE=Am I the only man with this fantasy?  I can't stop thinking about conjoined twins.  It's such a turn-on!  Maybe it's that CNT TV show!   What happens when one isn't in the mood?  What happens if you put one of the heads under water?  Can one get drunk and the other one drive?  Does it count as a threesome?  So many questions and I want the answers.  Like the old saying goes - two heads are better than one.  I'm ready to do this.  Send me an email with lots of photos.  I've got more than enough loving for both of you.
