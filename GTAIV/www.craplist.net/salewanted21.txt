;0x778E9C66=It used to be my signature move!  The headbang, the windmill, the slide across the floor on my knees.  Chicks loved it!  Then it all fell apart.  I don't know how it happened.  It doesn't even look like a guitar any more.  People just stare at me like I can't dance.  I've tried everything, even the air ukulele, but I can't get it to work.  Hopefully, you'll have better luck.  If you can fix it, it will get you a lot of ass.
