;0x2C339F1E=My isolation bunker is finished!  It is a cozy but functional space: bedroom, living room, bathroom (with rudimentary plumbing), blast ceiling, Geiger counter, and a masturbatorium.  I have board games, a record player and enough instant noodles to last three years (which should be long enough, by my calculations).  It has its own water well and small solar-powered generator, cleverly disguised as a bird table.  I've done the best I can with the time available to me.  Oh, and we recycle human waste.
0x2C339F1E=我的堡垒基地完工了！麻雀虽小五脏俱全：卧室、客厅、浴室(有供水设施)、炫酷的天花板、盖格计数器，还有一间自慰室。我有很多桌游、一台唱片机，以及足够撑上三年的方便面(据我计算，三年应该够长了)。堡垒里还有水井和小型太阳能发电机，太阳能板巧妙的伪装成了喂鸟器。已经是在我有限的时间里能达到的最高水平了。噢，还有一个排泄物再生系统。

;0x5E89D8E4=There is room for three people but you have to move quickly.  I have to limit you to a single backpack so please choose your belongings wisely.  Some air freshener might be a good idea.  I'm leaving my wife behind so I need at least one woman of child-bearing age.  Save yourselves.  They are coming.  We haven't got long.  I am battening down the hatches at 11:06 tomorrow morning.   
0x5E89D8E4=堡垒可以容纳三个人，但你必须尽快行动了。只允许你携带一个背包的行李入住，所以还请好好选择要带的物品。带上一些空气清新剂就挺不错的。我不打算带上老婆，所以需要至少一个孕龄女性。赶快自救吧，他们来了。我们的时间不多了。我会在明早11:06开始备战。
