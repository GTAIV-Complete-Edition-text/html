;0x2C339F1E=My isolation bunker is finished!  It is a cozy but functional space: bedroom, living room, bathroom (with rudimentary plumbing), blast ceiling, Geiger counter, and a masturbatorium.  I have board games, a record player and enough instant noodles to last three years (which should be long enough, by my calculations).  It has its own water well and small solar-powered generator, cleverly disguised as a bird table.  I've done the best I can with the time available to me.  Oh, and we recycle human waste.

;0x5E89D8E4=There is room for three people but you have to move quickly.  I have to limit you to a single backpack so please choose your belongings wisely.  Some air freshener might be a good idea.  I'm leaving my wife behind so I need at least one woman of child-bearing age.  Save yourselves.  They are coming.  We haven't got long.  I am battening down the hatches at 11:06 tomorrow morning.
