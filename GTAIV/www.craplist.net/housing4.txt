;0xFAFC5698=When my mother-in-law died, I thought I'd seen the end of unwanted house guests.  Then we moved to Little Bay.  It seemed like we'd found our dream home - airy, spacious rooms, a beautiful yard and lots of character.  Too much character, it turns out.  We'd only been there a few weeks when it started.  Footsteps in the night, doors slamming, the smell of strange perfume...  The feel of someone's hand on my thigh.   Until furniture starting flying across the room, I was convinced that my husband was having an affair and had been poisoning my food.  I have the constant sensation of being watched, and not just by the weird kid with the big head who lives next door.  My dream home has become a living nightmare.  If you can put up with the flashing lights, cold spots, scratching noises, small child talking to a television, and the overwhelming feeling of dread, this house is a steal.  I can't.  If you want more bangs for your buck, email me today to set up an appointment. 
0xFAFC5698=丈母娘死了的那天，我还以为再也不会有乱七八糟的人来家里做客了。我们就搬到了Little Bay，当时那里简直是我们理想的家：宽敞通风的房间、美丽的院子、各种各样的人。最后发现人太多了，刚搬进去几周就出了状况。夜晚的脚步声，摔门声，古怪的香水味... 感觉有人摸我屁股。直到房间里的家具到处乱跑，我才确定是我丈夫在搞外遇，而且他还在给我下毒。我一直有种被人监视的感觉，不仅仅是因为隔壁家的那个大头小子。理想的家最后成了我的噩梦。如果你可以忍受闪烁的灯光、特别冷的房间、刮东西的声音、小孩对着电视说话、巨大的恐惧，这间房子就很划算。我忍不了。如果你想要价廉物美的房子，邮件联系，我们约个时间。
