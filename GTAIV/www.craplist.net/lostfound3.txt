;0xAC80F44B=I think that I lost my cell phone on the subway from Suffolk to Westminster at around 8:30 last night.  I cannot stress enough how important it is that this is returned to me or destroyed as soon as possible.  The model is a Panoramic and there are about 20 pictures featuring an elderly gentlemen, a young Malaysian boy and a series of kitchen utensils.  You must understand that a man in my position cannot be seen to be associated with sensitive content of this nature.  I promised my wife that I had got all this out of my system and, if she sees what I was doing with her spatula, I am a dead man. I am prepared to offer a reward of $2,000, even though it is all quite explainable and innocent.  If I see any of that stuff online, I'll sue you so hard your grandkids will owe me money. 
0xAC80F44B=昨晚8:30左右，我的手机在从Suffolk开往Westminster的地铁上丢了。这部手机真的很重要，请捡到的人务必尽快归还或是直接销毁。是一部全景牌的手机，里面有20多张照片，拍到了一位老绅士、一个年轻的马来西亚小子，还有一大堆厨具。你要明白，我这个位置的人绝不能被人爆出如此敏感的内容。我跟老婆保证过以后不这么玩的，要是被她知道我用锅铲做了什么，我就死定了。尽管这些照片还有解释的余地，不一定有问题，但我还是愿意提供2000块报酬。如果被我在网上看见那些照片，我一定会告到你子子孙孙都欠我钱。
