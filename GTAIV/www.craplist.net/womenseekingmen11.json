All we need to know is college jocks + Cherenkov vodka = a kickass Tuesday night.  We can't flunk this year again.  We need a geek to do our homework.  We won't make out with you but we'll show you stuff you might never see again without paying for it.  All the guys want us cos we're like sooooooooooooooooo hot.  This needs to be VERY discreet - there's no way we can be seen with you in public.",
