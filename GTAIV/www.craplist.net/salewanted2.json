I was so excited when I bought it.  I couldn't wait to put it through its paces with the first drunken college chick I could find.  Then it happened.  My mojo was gone.  I haven't had any action for over 6 months!  Not a sniff.  My game has completely fallen apart.  I've crashed and burned more times than Samantha Muldoon's career.  Even fat chicks have been passing me up!  Why did I throw my smelly old futon into the river?!!  It can't be a coincidence.  That bed is jinxed.",
        "translated": "必须得把这张床处理掉。别误会了，作为家具它还是不错的：结实的支架、记忆床垫、红木床头板。刚到手的时候我还很兴奋，迫不及待地想找个喝醉的学生妹上床测试一下，结果就出事了。我的桃花运没了，足足半年没约到姑娘！碰都没碰到过一下。我的人生彻底完了。惨败而归的次数比Samantha Muldoon还多。连那些胖妞都不搭理我了！怎么就把那张有股味儿的旧沙发床扔河里了呢？！！一定不是巧合，这张床自带厄运。",
