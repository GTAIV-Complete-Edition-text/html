        "original": "I phoned in sick this morning after a crazy night on the liqs.  I still feel loaded now!  I'm starting to think those pills weren't aspirin.  I was hoping to leave a quick message with my secretary but that bitch of an intern patched me straight through to my boss.  He started firing questions at me and, for some unknown reason, I blurted out that I had conjunctivitis!  IDIOT!  Why couldn't I just have said a sore throat or a migraine?!!!  Anyway, it's done now and I need to find someone in Liberty City with conjunctivitis TODAY!  I've missed five days this month and they're starting to get very suspicious and threatening a drug test.  I've heard it's pretty contagious so this shouldn't take too long.  I'll pay you $200.  Not bad for a few germs!",
