About 10x8x20.  I'm willing to rent it out for $200 a week, no questions asked.  I don't care what you put down there, so long as it doesn't smell or corrode my record collection.  It's a nice neighborhood and I'm a cop so this is as low-profile as it gets.  First come, first served.",
        "translated": "刚把地下室清理干净。终于啊！没想到有生之年我能把那堆东西都丢到公园里。整完之后底下还挺好的，大概有3x2.5x6立方米的空间吧。租金每周两百，不问用途。只要不是气味太大，不会损坏我的档案资料，你在底下做什么都行。街区环境不错，我本人是个警察，这个地下室再隐蔽不过了。先到先得。",
