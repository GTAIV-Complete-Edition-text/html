It's amazing how far a fake grad school certificate can get you!  Now they want me to take a drug test on Monday!!  I can't believe it.  I thought all investment bankers did was bang coke up their noses.  I need some clean urine ASAP - after the month I've had, I've got as much chance of passing as the Fist tour bus.  Oh yeah, and it should be from a child.  Pure as the driven snow... I'm not taking any chances.  Name your price.",
