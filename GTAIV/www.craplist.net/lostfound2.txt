;0xEE6EAE9A=Yesterday I woke up on a sidewalk in Vice City with no memory of the last two weeks.  I am FREAKED OUT!  I mean, I've had blackouts before but nothing longer than two or three days and never ending up in another place!  I was wearing a sarong and there's a tattoo of what looks like an anchor on my left thigh.  That's the last time I'm mixing absinthe, mescaline and tranquilizers.  Seemed like such a good idea at the time.  My ass is killing me but I don't want to even think about that at the moment.  I just need to piece my life back together.  My last memory was talking to a bunch of dudes in Middle Park 13 days ago.  According to my credit card statement I was in Club Liberty the Saturday before last, at the Glory Hole Theme Park in San Andreas last Thursday and spent at least two days in the Spanish town of Sitges.  I'm 37, white, ponytail, medium build and my name is Danny Fisher (actually, just remembered, I now have cornrows).  PLEASE get in touch if you think you saw or met me.  I'm not looking forward to the flashbacks.  This is going to take some explaining to my wife.
