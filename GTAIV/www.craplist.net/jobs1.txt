;0x0C69A75F=My brother-in-law thinks he's so funny with his salty toothbrushes and plastic wrap over the toilet bowl.  Well, anything he can do, I can do better.  I need a couple of Arab guys (beards preferable) for about 3 hours next Tuesday afternoon.  You should bring backpacks and be open to a bit of role-playing.  I'll sort out an alarm clock and some duct tape.  Don't worry - I'll explain everything at the time.  This is going to be fun!  $50 each.
