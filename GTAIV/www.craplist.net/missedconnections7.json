        "original": "You were a guy (early 40s) in a black turtleneck standing in line at the Bean Machine Coffee in Star Junction with your daughter (early teens) last Thursday.  You clocked me checking her out big time.  I even shook my head and mouthed 'wow' to myself as I ran my eyes hungrily over her tanned, lithe body.  Busted!  The expression in your eyes said it all - hatred mingled with disappointment and understanding.  I don't know what I was thinking.  I felt disgusted with myself, especially later that evening.  Anyway, I just wanted to say that I'm sorry.  The last thing any father wants to see is some drunk guy drooling over his daughter.  So why do you let her wear shorts that don't ever cover her hard little ass?!!!!",
        "translated": "你是40出头的男性，上周四穿着一件黑色高领，带着女儿(才上小学吧)在星汇广场的冰的咖啡排队。我盯着你的女儿看，然后你就狠狠地给了我一拳。饥渴的目光扫过她柔软微黑的身体，看得我摇头晃脑，暗自赞叹。啪！当场被打！你的眼神就说明了一切，厌恶、不满、理解融为一体。都不知道我当时是怎么想的。我觉得自己很恶心，晚上还觉得更恶心了。好了，其实我是想跟你说一声：对不起。任何父亲都不希望有醉鬼对着自己的女儿发情。那你还让她穿着连屁股都遮不全的短裤出门？！！！！",
