;0x4C9AE530=My apartment is infested with insects.  They're everywhere!!!!!!  I can't sleep, I can't eat.  They crawl all over me, eating away at my skin.  I can't stop scratching   I can't get rid of them.  And I think my roommate's trying to kill me.  It's a nightmare.  I've called out two exterminators in the last week but they were fucking amateurs.  Trees.  Swat teams.  Pool of blood.  What? Who are you?  I kept screaming "I'm covered in them" but they just looked at me like I was some kind of lunatic.  I can't take much more of this.  I need somebody to deal with this TODAY.  I can't pay you but I've got a massive bag of tina.
