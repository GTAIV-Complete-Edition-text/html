;0xB02AEC4D=OK, I'll lay it on the line.  I've started taking off my wedding ring and leaving it in the hotel when I'm away on business.  I know I'm a dog.  I'm not proud of it, believe me.  Most of the time I don't even get any ass, at least not without paying for it.  I must be having a mid-life crisis.  I even bought some designer jeans last week.  I'm normally so careful but somewhere between the hotel, restaurant, massage parlor and strip club, I managed to lose the damn thing somewhere in Algonquin last night.  It's a gold band with an engraving in Sanskrit that, like a FUCKING DUMBASS, I never wrote down anywhere.  I can't even remember what it means - I had the mother of hangovers on my wedding day.  If you have found it, sold it, pawned it, seen it... ANYTHING, please let me know.  I will double your money.  I'm back home now in Verona Beach, Los Santos, and I'm not going to be able to hide this for much longer.  I can't believe she hasn't noticed yet. 
0xB02AEC4D=好了，我就直说吧。出差办公的时候我都会摘下婚戒，放在酒店里。我也知道自己不咋地，心里还是有数的。大部分时候我都泡不到女人，除非是花钱找人陪。平常我很小心的，但昨晚往返于Algonquin的酒店、参观、按摩店和脱衣舞俱乐部的时候不知道在哪儿丢了。是一个金戒指，上面用印度字刻了类似于「傻逼玩意」的东西，原文我没记。我连刻的字是啥意思都忘了，大概因为是从结婚那天开始就染上了宿醉吧。如果你 找到/卖掉/典当/见过... 它，怎样都好，请联系我。我愿意出双倍的钱。我已经回到洛圣都维罗纳海滩的家了，绝对瞒不了老婆多久。她到现在还没发现才有点奇怪。
