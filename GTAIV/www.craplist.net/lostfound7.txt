;0xB02AEC4D=OK, I'll lay it on the line.  I've started taking off my wedding ring and leaving it in the hotel when I'm away on business.  I know I'm a dog.  I'm not proud of it, believe me.  Most of the time I don't even get any ass, at least not without paying for it.  I must be having a mid-life crisis.  I even bought some designer jeans last week.  I'm normally so careful but somewhere between the hotel, restaurant, massage parlor and strip club, I managed to lose the damn thing somewhere in Algonquin last night.  It's a gold band with an engraving in Sanskrit that, like a FUCKING DUMBASS, I never wrote down anywhere.  I can't even remember what it means - I had the mother of hangovers on my wedding day.  If you have found it, sold it, pawned it, seen it... ANYTHING, please let me know.  I will double your money.  I'm back home now in Verona Beach, Los Santos, and I'm not going to be able to hide this for much longer.  I can't believe she hasn't noticed yet.
