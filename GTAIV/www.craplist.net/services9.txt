;0xB5CAD33B=I know it's not very lady-like to admit it but I've blocked my toilet.  A coiler of serpentine proportions.  Now for the second admission - this happened a few days ago.  I closed the door on the problem and I've been procrastinating ever since.  Every now and then I can't handle it anymore and hope another couple of logs will press it down.  I finally plucked up the courage to take a look this morning and things have gotten a lot worse.  It smells like somebody died in there.  Truly disgusting.  I really can't handle it.  I gag opening a tin of cat food.  Can somebody please help me?!!  I'm 36D-26-32 with blonde hair and I promise to make it worth your while.  Bring rubber gloves and a hazmat suit.
