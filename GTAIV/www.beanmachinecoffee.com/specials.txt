;0xEBC621F1=It's 11am, your blood-sugar levels have crashed and you've lost the will to live.

One visit to Bean Machine and we will have you back on track, for a couple of hours at least.  The 'High Noon' special combines a pint of drip coffee, half a pint of carbonated water, a taurine depth charge and a choice of 134 different fruit syrups.  You'll feel like you've crossed a time-zone by mid afternoon!  Not responsible for anal leakage.
