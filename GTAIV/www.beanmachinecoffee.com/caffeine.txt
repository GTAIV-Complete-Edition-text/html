;0x55C3BF9A=How can something that suppresses hunger, increases levels of dopamine, causes rapid flow of thought and produces rambling, incoherent speech be considered a drug?  How can anything grown in Central America be addictive?  This is just evil propaganda from the health food industry, a desperate marketing gimmick to sell more fruit smoothies and granola bars and make you shit corn.  Drugs are nasty, illegal things that come in little plastic bags.  Have you ever seen a guy lying in the gutter injecting cappuccino into his eyeball or a coffee whore blasting java beans through a glass pipe?

;0x14438B8B=Ever tried multi-tasking without coffee?  It's impossible, especially for men.
