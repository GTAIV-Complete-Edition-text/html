;0xB39293E9=Do you feel restless, irritable and paranoid?  Has your morning been dominated by panic attacks, mood swings, outbursts at strangers and psychotic behavior?  Must be time for another coffee!  Coffee is an ancient extract that the Mayans used to stay focused when sacrificing virgins. Or so we tell ourselves. We actually don't know.  Unlike the Mayans, you are never more than 500 yards away from a Bean Machine coffee shop and we are always on hand to pump up your heart rate and send you on your way with a smile on your face and a burning need to piss every ten minutes. It's the end point of civilization.
0xB39293E9=你觉得自己疲劳、易怒、多疑吗？你是否经常在早晨出现急性焦虑，情绪波动，对陌生人大发雷霆等精神病行为？那你该来杯咖啡了！咖啡是一种古老的提取物，玛雅人献祭处子时就会用咖啡保持专注。至少我们是这么告诉自己的。不像玛雅人，你的500米范围内一定会有冰的咖啡的门店，我们时刻准备着让你心跳加速，面带微笑地离去，还会让你隔十分钟就感到尿急。这就是文明的终点。

;0xEA33B4EF=The perma-grin of a glassy-eyed barista after eight espressos, the noise of teeth-grinding and leg-tapping mingled with putrid soft jazz, the grainy photos of smiling plantation workers, the warm feeling when a disgruntled teenager calls you by the name scrawled on the side of a plastic cup... Our coffee shops are so much more than just great places to take a crap and surf online auctions:  they are a lifestyle choice for the status-conscious consumer - the kind of go-getter who really cares about his beverage choice, because the rest of life is completely pointless.  Carry your paper cup like a badge of honor on the subway.  Show your co-workers you mean business by ingesting 20 ounces of caffeine.  Nothing screams "upwardly-mobile sophisticate" like a logoed polystyrene yuppie bucket of muddy brown water.
0xEA33B4EF=喝了八杯意式的目光呆滞的咖啡师脸上不变的微笑，磨牙和抖腿的响声与柔和的爵士乐混杂，笑眯眯的种植园工人的颗粒感照片，不高兴的年轻人用塑料杯上草草书写的名字喊你的温暖感觉... 我们的门店不只是解决三急和参加网络拍卖的地方，更是有格调的消费者的生活方式。他们是在意饮品种类的进取者，因为生命中的其他事都毫无意义。拿着装咖啡的纸杯走进地铁，这就是你的荣誉勋章。摄入20盎司咖啡因，让同事知道你是认真的。只有装在印着LOGO的聚苯乙烯精致水桶里的泥水，才能说明你的上流腔调。

;0x2F2C8455=We depend on you; you depend on caffeine.  Customer satisfaction is a top priority at Bean Machine Coffee and we are dedicated to providing efficient and courteous service at all times, except if there is a line, or when there isn't.  Just don't ask us to wash out your personal mug or we will turn on you in a heartbeat.  We know from watching you clawing at the window and twitching nervously at the counter every morning that your coffee is important and we pledge to serve every drink within three minutes or sack one of our minimum-wage employees on the spot. Or both.
0x2F2C8455=我们靠顾客生存，你靠咖啡因生存。让顾客满意是冰的咖啡的首要任务，我们专注于为顾客提供高效、谦逊的服务，排长队时除外，不排队时也差不多。别让我们帮忙清洗自带的马克杯就行了，否则我们直接跟你翻脸。看你每天早上挠着柜台玻璃哆哆嗦嗦的样子就知道咖啡对你有多重要，因此我们保证会在三分钟内为你送上咖啡，送不上就把这个拿着最低工资的员工当场开除。也可能既送上了咖啡，又开除了员工。

;0x482AEAB7=Bean Machine prides itself on its global presence - some of the most romantic and authentic places now have identical Bean Machine locations.  Going abroad is terrifying enough without having to deal with strange-tongued barbarians who stare at you blankly when you yell at them for a vanilla macchiato no soy hold the masculinity.  From Denver to Dhaka, we are firmly committed to creating a uniform, unwavering, singular global experience for all coffee drinkers.  Each of our coffee shops is identical in layout and decor so that you can stand in the same snaking assembly line and sit in the same maroon armchair wherever you are in the world, sheltered from the hideous threat of foreign culture that lurks around every corner.      
0x482AEAB7=冰的咖啡以遍布全球的门店为傲，即便是最浪漫、最体现当地风土人情的地方，也有和这里完全相同的冰的咖啡。前往国外已经够可怕了，更别说还会遇到口音怪异的野蛮人，你大喊着「来一杯香子兰玛奇朵不加豆奶」，他还会一脸茫然地盯着你。从科罗拉多州的丹佛到孟加拉国的达卡，我们坚持为所有喝咖啡的顾客提供单一、统一、始终如一的消费体验。每一家门店的装修和布局都完全一致，无论身处何处，你都能站在相同的蛇形队列当中，坐在相同位置的红褐色座椅上，不受无处不在的丑恶外国文化影响。

;0x5DFB7637=Pick up a Bean Machine Day Pass at a store near you.  Buy 9 coffees over the course of a day and we will give you the 10th for free!
0x5DFB7637=去附近的门店来张冰的咖啡一日券吧。一天之内消费九杯咖啡，即可免费获赠第十杯！

;0x0B07BF9B=Bean Machine opens coffee houses at Machu Picchu and the Taj Mahal! Next stop, Everest. 
0x0B07BF9B=冰的咖啡已于马丘比丘和泰姬陵开设门店！下一站，珠穆朗玛。

;0x2F12DF62=No experience required.  Bean Machine is always looking for unskilled, part-time workers, primarily because all our staff turns over every three weeks.  We prefer to use the term 'friends' rather than 'employees' and 'protectors' rather than 'managers'.  We find that this helps to foster the illusion of a warm, fuzzy working environment and masks the exploitation at the core of our business model.  We are not going to insult you with training.  This is coffee, not rocket science.  Don't worry; you'll soon learn the art of looking down your nose when someone orders a regular coffee. 
0x2F12DF62=无需工作经验。冰的咖啡长期招聘脑子不好使的非熟练临时工，主要还是因为我们的员工隔三周就会换一批人。我们更喜欢称「雇员」为「同学」，称「经理」为「老师」。因为我们发现这样可以创造出一个看似温暖的工作环境，模糊我们商业模式的剥削本质。没有让人苦恼的培训，冲杯咖啡而已，不是什么技术活。别担心，用不了多久你就能学会看人下菜的艺术了。

;0xBECB7FD6=Join the biggest company in the world!  We will hire anyone, so long as they look young.  If you listen to emo music and have great tits, that's a plus, but a tattoo or facial piercing is preferred to give us that "edge."          
0xBECB7FD6=加入全球最大的企业吧！只要长得年轻，我们就会雇佣。听情绪硬核、有大咪咪都是加分项，如果有纹身或者面部穿环那就是好中好了。
