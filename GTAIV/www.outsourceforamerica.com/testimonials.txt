;0x34919844="When I set up my little call center in Beijing back in the early 80's, little did I realize that it would quickly grow into a multi-million-dollar offshoring empire. Milking the cash cow and kissing the udders, as you say in America! Unfortunately, the double-D bra growth of my wife in recent years has meant that operations are very expensive. It's too expensive to outsource in China. When I approached Outsource For America for some advice on streamlining my business model, they recommended that it would be more cost-effective to outsource our payroll and database management to Texas. The people there are dolts and will work for nothing if you let them have a square dance break and some beer after work.  There have been a few teething problems with cross-cultural issues and the heavily-accented Mandarin but the benefits to the bottom line have been tremendous. Those guys will do anything for a few dollars and a keg of beer! We've never looked back!"       
0x34919844=「八十年代早期，刚在北京成立我的小型呼叫中心时，我根本没有想到它会以如此快的速度成长为一个价值数百万美元的外包帝国。用你们美国的话说就是：边挤金牛的钱，边吸金牛的奶！只可惜最近几年我老婆长出来的DD杯乳房还是贵了点。这项业务太贵了，没法外包给中国。接触到外包美国劳动时，我向他们咨询了如何优化我的商业模型，他们建议我将工资核算与数据管理的工作外包到德州。那里的人都是傻子，只要给他们提供用来跳舞的休息时间和下班后的酒水，他们就肯打白工。尽管早期遇到了一些不同文化之间的障碍，他们说普通话的口音也很重，但公司的收益是巨大的。这些人愿意为了几块钱和一壶酒愿意做任何事！我们从来没考虑过抛弃他们！」

;0x81AF69C9="Man, business was bad a couple of years ago. I was thinking of turning out my daughter it was so bad. All the doctors and bankers who used to pay for the girls on my corner lost their jobs and started hitting the crack whores on the other side of town. Human trafficking was getting too expensive and I was tired of rounding up runaways at the train station. I was very close to quitting the pimp game for good until I spoke to Outsource For America. Now I own a gleaming new service center in Eastern Europe where thousands of skinny chicks turn tricks around the clock in a computer-simulated virtual reality. Through the wonders of teledildonic technology, I've been able to slash my costs and they're lining up the street in Liberty City for my $2 blow-jobs. I have to do all my bitchslapping by email now but you have to move with the times..."

;0x8C58AFF5="Listen. I'm tired of liberals complaining about this stuff. Capitalism means I make a lot of money and I don't care who gets kicked to the curb in the meantime. Outsource For America did a fantastic job helping us to move our operations overseas. We were very keen to be able to mirror our domestic business as closely as possible including having an ass-slapping misogynist Director, a sexually confused Line Manager that would talk to girls' tits and stick his hand up the Receptionist's skirt at the Christmas party and appalling morale for everyone. They found foreign workers who will do this for a fraction of the cost of our smarmy U.S. sales director. A promising start!"       
0x8C58AFF5=「听着，我已经不想听自由派抱怨这种事情了。资本主义就是说要赚很多钱，我才不在乎有谁丢了工作。外包美国劳动让我们得以将业务转移到海外，帮了我们大忙。当时我们很想在国外复制一个于国内尽可能相似的生产环境。需要一个厌女的主人和一个很麻烦的直线经理。后者会盯着姑娘的胸部说话，在圣诞派对上把手伸到接待员裙底，吓出所有人的士气。他们在国外找到了符合条件的工人，工资还只有我们爱拍马屁的美国销售主任的零头。这是一个充满希望的开头！」
