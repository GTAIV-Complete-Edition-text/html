Milking the cash cow and kissing the udders, as you say in America! Unfortunately, the double-D bra growth of my wife in recent years has meant that operations are very expensive. It's too expensive to outsource in China. When I approached Outsource For America for some advice on streamlining my business model, they recommended that it would be more cost-effective to outsource our payroll and database management to Texas. The people there are dolts and will work for nothing if you let them have a square dance break and some beer after work.  There have been a few teething problems with cross-cultural issues and the heavily-accented Mandarin but the benefits to the bottom line have been tremendous. Those guys will do anything for a few dollars and a keg of beer! We've never looked back!\"",
