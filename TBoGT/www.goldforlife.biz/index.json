It will be a return to the golden era; a time when religious bigots roamed the countryside drinking mead and raping maidens and when a bag of groats got you a night at an inn with a young farm boy. In South Dakota and Nevada, where the majority of American gold is produced, this has already started. In these difficult economic times, it's amazing what a quick root through your grandma's jewelry box or local graveyard can yield.",
