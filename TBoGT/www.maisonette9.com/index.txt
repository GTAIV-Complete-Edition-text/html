;0x146A2715=Founded in 2003 by Liberty City's 20 year reigning king of Liberty City's nightlife, Tony Prince, Maisonette 9 is small, cramped, expensive, over crowded and definitely not for you. So please, don't  bother stopping by, on the off chance we were wondering where you had  been all our lives, let's be really clear - we weren't waiting for you, and we did not want you. Unless you are rich, beautiful and famous, you will feel pretty inadequate here, so why put yourself through that?  Therapy is really expensive and it doesn't work.
