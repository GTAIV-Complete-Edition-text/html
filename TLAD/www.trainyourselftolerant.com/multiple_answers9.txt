;0x1CEFDA94=Very in touch with your emotions.  You were born to be PC.  But this can sometimes be a good approach, especially if you're married.

The only way to truly deal with a problem is to make it go away.
0x7729A1AE=然而，如果是同事，每天你都要面对这份羞耻。走廊里的尴尬偶遇、电梯里的痛苦死寂，无不提醒着你激情肛交的那个淫荡夜晚。你真的想在接下来的几个月里畏首畏尾，躲在门后，躲进洗手间吗？解决问题的唯一方法就是让对方消失。

;0x2445B884=D)...immediately email them a photo of your junk under the heading,
0x2445B884=D)...立即打开邮箱，给对方发自己的生殖器照片，

;0x0B2D57FC="Ding, ding.  Ready for round 2?"

If he/she replies with something along the lines of "I'd rather have a root canal", then resort to options B or C.
0x4F023FB9=既然可以用电锯打破尴尬，何必露出尴尬又不失礼貌的微笑呢？在裤裆上钉一串浆果，走到对方的办公桌前，拿自己的裤裆开个玩笑。给办公室来点性诱惑，工作的时光过得更快。除非对方是正宗大肥猪，否则也没什么损失吧？如果对方的答复类似于「比起跟你在一起，我宁愿去做根管治疗」，那就改选选项B或者选项C。
