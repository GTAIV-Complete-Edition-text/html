Now droves of needy twenty-somethings are starting to infest the workplace. They want time off for yoga, plenty of signing bonuses, back rubs, free sushi and scuba lessons. They want to roll into work at noon, break for lunch at 1pm, go to Jazz Tae Kwon Do at 3pm and be home by 4pm to watch reruns of their blessed crappy 90's sitcoms. This is the dumbed-down generation that's been told it's clever. Just because they express their feelings with emoticons. Yes, you'd better believe it. The Millennials have arrived.",
