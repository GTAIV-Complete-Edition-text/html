;0x1E7AA8B9=At some point, this generation was deluded into thinking that dirty feet in flip-flops, full-sleeve tattoos, multiple facial piercings and loose fitting tank tops that reveal massive amounts of cleavage is somehow the appropriate attire for a marketing meeting with a top 100 client. Don't you dare tell them to dress appropriately or you'll be sued into the ground for "sexism and discrimination."

;0xF98EEE88=They've grown up expecting to be rewarded just for showing up. It's not enough to pay Millennials for their work; you have to THANK them for it. Give out certificates, trophies, balloons and gold stars for things like 'Kindness', 'Tolerance' and 'Instant Messaging'. If somebody completes a project on time, gather people around their desk to applaud them and present them with some movie tickets. Hold a monthly 'Helicopter Parents Day' so that the Millennials' overbearing mommies and daddies can hear first-hand how well their little angels are performing.

;0x5EB6395B=Growing up in a digital age has given Millennials the delusion that they are some kind of hot commodity. Unable to spell or focus on one thing, they think that just because they can download music to an MP3 player, they have the monopoly on tech-savvy. They assume that just because they can talk on a mobile phone while checking their email, listening to a mashup and watching video clips, they're somehow efficient and actually doing something meaningful. They believe that just because they've got a million virtual friends on their

;0x991C199A= page, they have superior communication skills. Remember, these people put their painfully boring diaries online, give it a new name like "blog" and assume that their idiotic opinion actually matters. This means, as a manager or coworker of a millennial, you will need to pretend to seriously consider all their naïve ideas. Lie to them about how vital their contribution is to the success of your company.

;0x5C37F3C4=Good luck trying to have a productive meeting or delegating  work. Start thinking of yourself as a babysitter rather than a boss. Millennials hate to be micromanaged yet cannot complete any task without continuous supervision and back talk. They've had their whole lives organized for them and lack the capacity to think or solve problems on their own. This is Generation WHY - don't expect any initiative; you need to show them exactly what to do every step of the way. If not, you will absolutely enjoy the look on their face when you fire them. You haven't seen stunned disbelief until a 20-something who has been coddled by mommy and daddy her whole life is told to hit the bricks. Toots.

;0x79DDBAAB=These people aren't looking for a career. They are looking for a bullet point on a social networking site. They have about as much loyalty as a hooker at a frat party. The next gig that comes along, they're out the door, before their first company Christmas party. They fully expect to be paid more for working less and, if you put them under too much pressure, they will simply quit and move back in with their rich Baby-Boomer parents. They're likely to ask for a promotion after two days, a corner office after two weeks and a career break to go backpacking around South America after two months.

;0x478B4F87=They may be just starting at the company in a lower level position, but they want a Bittersweet so they can send email and make mobile phone calls on the company's dime. Yoga classes, acupuncture, car service rides home if they work past 6 PM; you haven't seen entitlement until you get an expense report on your desk with multiple sushi lunches and bar tabs with explanations next to them that "we talked about work." Remember, you're subsidizing their lifestyle.

;0x399C1310=Millennials are praise junkies who crave approval, recognition and validation for everything they do. They've spent their whole lives being told that they're special by enabling parents and teachers. Think of everything you say as a verbal pat on the back. Hug them, look into their eyes and tell them that they're valued. Send them a text message that says WE LUV U UR GR8. Set up an 'Attaboy Reynolds Booth' or hold a daily 'Compliment Shower' in the conference room. Do whatever you have to do to keep their egos inflated.

;0x6C41671B=Millennials have the attention span of a squirrel and require constant stimulation. They also don't like to feel as if they're doing a job and are obsessed with work-life balance, meaning they work about 10% of the time and spend the rest of the day whining on message boards. Everything is more important than work to a Millennial. Forget about overtime and weekends. They claim to be goal-oriented but don't actually want to do any work and have never been taught how to cope with stress. Try to organize your workload around their personal life. Set aside a few hours of every day for social networking, a couple more for therapy and another hour for apologizing to them about the fact they will have to do some work.
0x6C41671B=

;0xED7899F5=They've been brought up in a culture of instant gratification where people become rich and famous for eating animal penises on reality TV or singing like a wounded animal in a TV singer contest. They claim to follow politics and point to being politically active by whining on their blog. Millennials DON'T vote. If they claim to need to come in late so they can vote THEY ARE LYING. The only thing they vote in is the Shitty Singer Competition on CNT.

;0x8912DB9B=This generation loves watching TV shows about rich people their age. They believe that because a few people got rich launching social networking sites that nobody cares about a few months later, they are on the same track. Every millennial believes it is their divine right to be a millionaire by 30. As an older manager, you stand in the way of this. However, as a bonus, many Millennials aren't averse to sleeping their way to the top. However, see the next point as a warning.
