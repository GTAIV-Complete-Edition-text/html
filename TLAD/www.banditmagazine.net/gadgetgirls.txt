;0x22624E60=Bethany knows - any man that has this phone will have her dropping to her knees.  And with good reason. Nobody thought the day would come when people would sleep out in the rain for four weeks to be first in line for a device that gives you the convenience of paying $100 a month for people to text you shitfaced at 3 A.M. But that day has arrived. Studies have shown that man cannot be truly happy without one. It's a juggernaut of marketing hype that can't be stopped. It's more important than you and me. Finally, a device that plays music, sends emails and takes upskirt photographs - who'd have thought it was possible? It's the iFruit 3G. A slab of shiny Chinese plastic, metal and glass in a range of fruity colors, the iFruit 3G is guaranteed to be covered in scratches and greasy fingerprints within minutes of taking it out the box. It's the same phone that everyone paid twice the price for a year ago but with slightly shittier internet, a full 30 minutes of battery time and G.P.S. that works if you hold it out the car window and read it through the glass. Mobile broadband coverage is now available in a few selected pockets of 3G network coverage around the country.

;0xE647182D=Get ready to soil yourself. This nifty device, modeled by buxom 18-year-old Shannon from San Fierro, has quickly established itself as the must-have gadget of the year.

Trim down your nose hairs, jot down her number, take down her psycho boyfriend. There might be better ways to spend your disposable income but we can't think of any. Aren't you glad you live in the First World?
