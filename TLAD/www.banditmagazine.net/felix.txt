;0xBF6860B6="You know my 3 golden rules when it comes to men's fashion: accessorize, accessorize, accessorize! No longer the preserve of criminals under house arrest, the ankle bracelet - or anklet as it's known within the scene - is picking up right where the toe-ring left off last season. Ankle bracelets help to draw attention to the contour of the calves and can really make a pair of flip-flops pop. Since you already dress like a surfer but have never actually ridden a board, keep the beach casual look going by wearing pointless jewelry that is supposed to make you feel spiritual. Felix x"

;0x5195C03C="Men have been wearing cufflinks since the middle ages and they're one of the first things a woman looks at when considering a future mate. There are few things more arousing than the sight of a decorative fastener with an archaic logo peeking out from the sleeve of a well-cut leisure blazer. Like the smell of a new pair of flame wingtips or the feel of a freshly-ironed pair of satin boxers, an elegant set of cufflinks can really make you feel good about yourself and the things you waste your income on.

;0x3390D684="Nothing screams class and breeding like a bespoke bathing suit - custom tailored to accentuate the abs, show off the ass, and make sure your little guy is in the perfect position to get her attention. Whether you're dressing down for a latte with the boys poolside or dressing up for an accidental run-in with the paparazzi, a hot new banana hammock and sarong adds flourish to any ensemble. Choose a bold color that brings out your eyes - show people you're a man who's not afraid to make a statement!
