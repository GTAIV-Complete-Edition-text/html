;0xBFEBD568=It's amazing what some girls will do for a can of beer and a chance to feel like someone is actually interested in them.  Once again, Bandit! has been out scouring parks, bus stations, freeway underpasses and public libraries across the country in search of the dirtiest hobo hos on the streets today.
0xBFEBD568=你一定想不到，为了一罐啤酒和一次体验成名感觉的机会，有些姑娘会做出什么事来。《Bandit!》再次跑遍了全国各个公园、车站、桥洞和图书馆，寻找街上最肮脏的流浪鸡。

;0x72BC89FC=Nobody can say that this month's winners don't have assets! Keep a hand free for Bambi and Ginger from East Los Santos (the names have been changed to protect them from their uncles). When they're not talking to themselves in shop windows, chasing pigeons, ranting at passers-by or dumpster diving for chicken nuggets, Bambi and Ginger usually spend their days turning tricks for dollar-bags of crack. 
0x72BC89FC=本月的两位赢家绝对具有十足的含金量！欢迎来自东洛圣都的Bambi和Ginger (为保护她们免遭自己叔叔的毒手，以上均为化名)。她们对着商店橱窗的倒影自言自语，追着鸽子，朝着路过的人大喊大叫，在垃圾箱里找着炸鸡。不做这些事的时候，Bambi和Ginger通常在给别人提供性服务，换取购买毒品的资金。
