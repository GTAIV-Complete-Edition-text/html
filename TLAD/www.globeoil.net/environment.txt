;0xEEA8B1A8=Apart from a few tanker spillages, refinery explosions, human rights abuses and devastated ecosystems, Globe Oil's environmental record is exemplary.

;0x4EA9ED91=Every decision we make here at Globe Oil affects the environment.  That's why we work daily to form low impact environmental initiatives so that we can continue raping the last of the Earth's fossil fuels while greenwashing our corporate image in the media.  90% of our marketing budget and 1% of our operating budget is now dedicated to alternative energy research and development.  We even have a road map. It's great. It's a map of a road.  As part of our Hydrocarbon Healthy Trees initiative, we have planted trees in close to a dozen sites around our office complex, while removing the trees that dropped sap on the CFO's sports car.  The CFO is great. He's having a mid-life crisis.

;0xB15AD475=At Globe Oil, you'll hear the word "sustainability" bandied around our office a lot.  We are concerned about sustaining the current level of record profits, repealing bans on drilling in national parks, and most of all, sustaining our company's pride in employees who can afford piles of blow that cost more than most people make all year.  That's why we spend a lot of money on lobbying in Washington. Without the perks we provide, civil servants would be bored and susceptible to terrorism, probably.

;0x239F966F=Some questionable links have been made between fossil fuels and global warming.  Much like the debate over intelligent design, evolution, and the assassination of JFK, there is the real story, and then there are the lies of scientists, eyewitnesses and the media.
