;0x1DF20CCB=Some people have questioned the dichotomy between our record profits and the skyrocketing gas prices.  Lobbying politicians, funding regime change, suppressing scientific research, reprinting all our marketing materials in a green font... oil has become an ever more costly business.  It is unfortunate that the countries with the largest remaining reserves of oil and gas happen to hate us, especially Canada.
0x1DF20CCB=有人怀疑我们创纪录的利润和疯涨的油价之间存在联系。游说政客、资助政权更替、压制科学研究、用绿色文字重新印刷我们的宣传材料... 石油工业的成本越来越高。很不幸，油气储量高的国家都很讨厌我们美国，特别是加拿大。

;0x92FEEC8F=It doesn't help that we've been forced into expensive ventures such as deepwater drilling and oil sand extraction because loony left-wing activists have conspired to ban us from extracting the natural resources right on our own doorstep.  Not to mention the pressure to invest in renewable energy.
0x92FEEC8F=更糟的是，那些左翼疯子还禁止我们开采自家门口的自然资源，因此我们只能选择成本更高的深海钻探和油砂分离技术。除此以外，投资可再生能源的压力也不容忽视。

;0x9BB8CDA5=Globe Oil is proud to be the largest corporate contributor to President Lawton's administration and we thank him for his continued stance on the Kyoto Treaty.   We support our troops. And by "our troops" we mean the independent contractors of hired guns that operate with impunity throughout war zones.  Energy is worth fighting for.
0x9BB8CDA5=能够成为Lawton政府最大的资助企业是环球石油的荣幸，我们也十分感谢他对京都议定书一以贯之的态度。我们支持我们的部队。当然，「我们的部队」是指四处征战不受惩罚的雇佣兵。为能源而战是值得的。
