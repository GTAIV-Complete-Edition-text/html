;0x1DF20CCB=Some people have questioned the dichotomy between our record profits and the skyrocketing gas prices.  Lobbying politicians, funding regime change, suppressing scientific research, reprinting all our marketing materials in a green font... oil has become an ever more costly business.  It is unfortunate that the countries with the largest remaining reserves of oil and gas happen to hate us, especially Canada.
