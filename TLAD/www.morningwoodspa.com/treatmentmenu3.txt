;0x932C6655=Lie back and let a wave of physical, emotional and spiritual wellbeing wash over you as 600 colors flash in front of your eyes and banging gabba techno plays in the background.  A stoner's dream.  An epileptic's nightmare.

;0xD6B9E364=It looks like a torture scene from a bad spy movie.  A sweating, plus-sized sociopath in a white coat holding down a screaming patient while hot wax drips onto the ear drum from a burning candle.

You'd pay $150 (or $180 if you're a man), that's what you'd do.
