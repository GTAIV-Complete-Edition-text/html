;0x19F42337=Never underestimate the profound healing and nurturing powers of smell.  The smell of rain can remind you of the time you got drunk and totaled your car in high school. The smell of oregano and red wine can remind you of when you had intercourse with mom's middle-aged boyfriend. Smells can trigger vivid memories, or not, in the case of chloroform.  Smells can be mood-enhancing, especially if huffed out of a paper bag.

Think happy thoughts.  Then pay us $100.

Certain spiritual healers, mostly the offspring of 1960's acid casualties, maintain that crystals, especially quartz crystals, have the ability to correct a person's natural energy flows.  Whatever that means...  Give it a try.  Stare into some glass for an hour while listening to whales copulate.  There are about 10,000 different religions in the world so, if you happen to put your faith in the wrong thing, it's not like you're the only one.
