A sweating, plus-sized sociopath in a white coat holding down a screaming patient while hot wax drips onto the ear drum from a burning candle.  The origins of ear candling are almost as obscure as its supposed health benefits but, in complete disregard for the laws of anatomy, practitioners claim that the procedure removes impurities from the body while the flame vibrates the air and transmits positive energy.",

What would you do if a creepy stranger in sandals and a kaftan told you that he had the ability to channel 'universal life energy' by taking you against your will and then leaving you to huddle in the corner of the shower crying?  You'd pay $150 (or $180 if you're a man), that's what you'd do.",
