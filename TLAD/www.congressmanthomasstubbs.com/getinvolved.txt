;0x1E2734C1=Politics is a great way for you to give back to your country, and by give back, we mean money.  Or you could be one of those idiots with clipboards standing in the street, getting on everybody's nerves.  In general, though, they don't make much difference as people tend not to listen to people with so little going on in their lives that they like standing in the rain with a clipboard. The most effective way to involve yourself in politics is to make a donation to someone like me, a rich guy with a big heart who cannot be bought for as little money as you are likely to offer, unless you are, say, an oil company or a nuclear power station or something, in which case, I probably can be bought so give me a call.
0x1E2734C1=政治是你感恩国家的好办法。具体来说，指的是花钱。不然就像那些在街头做民调的傻逼一样，惹得大家发火。这样吧，一般来说，这帮人没什么用，因为大家都不会去听平时没有存在感的人说的话，站在大雨的街头努力也没用。参与政治最高效的方法，就是捐款给像我这样有钱还心胸宽广的人。我可不是你随便花点钱就能打发的，除非你有石油公司，或者核电站之类的东西。这样的话我们才有得谈。所以，请联系我吧。
