;0xBC76FFED=You wake up next to a dumpster, caked in your own feces. Again. Your face is frozen to the sidewalk. It is winter and you're homeless. Some teenagers pay you a couple of dollars to fight other bums so that they can film it and sell the DVDs on the internet. You use the money to buy a bottle of raw ethanol from the hardware store and stagger down the street, picking cigarette butts out of the gutter. Eventually, you arrive at a house. A house that used to be yours...
0xBC76FFED=你在垃圾箱旁醒来，被自己的粪便埋没。已经不是第一次了。脸还被人行道冻着。现在是冬天，你无家可归。年轻人给了你几块钱，让你和其他流浪汉打架，他们则在一旁拍摄视频，准备录成DVD上网出售。你用这笔钱去五金店买了瓶酒精，在街上摇摇晃晃地捡着口香糖里的烟头。走着走着，你走到了一座房子跟前。那曾经是你的房子...

0xB9F02007=想要养家糊口确实很不容易，特别是在新款iFruit手机这样的必需品发布的时候。不能怪你。本来就不应该被自己的收入限制。这就是美国。我们的政府本身就欠了几万亿债。
