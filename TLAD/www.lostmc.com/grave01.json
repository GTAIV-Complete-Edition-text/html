Having lost an ear in a ice lab explosion back in '03, and not giving a shit about it, Harper prided himself on bein' the best cook of crystal south of the Canadian border. He had the purest shit and he didn't sell to homos - which is rare in this world of hypocrites and sellouts. He was an artisan and a patriot. Whenever I raise a pipe to my lips I'll miss this guy. I hope that ice cools him down in the firey pits of hell. The next time I see this SOB he'll be tweeking with the devil.",
        "translated": "Harper死于他最擅长的事情——炼制冰毒。03年的一次冰毒实验室爆炸夺去了他的一只耳朵，但他对此毫不在意，依然为自己是美加边境最牛逼的冰毒厨师而骄傲。他能烧出最纯净的货，还不卖给同性恋。在这个充满虚伪与背叛的世界上，这样的人难能可贵。他是一个工匠，也是一个爱国者。每次要爽上一口时我都会想起他。希望冰毒能让他在地狱的油锅里冰凉下来。下次再见到这个狗日的，估计他都已经和恶魔一起吸嗨了。",
