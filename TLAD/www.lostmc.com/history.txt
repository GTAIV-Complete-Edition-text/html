;0xB864A2F1=It was 1964 when eight US marines met in Hanoi. They bonded over a love of hookers, horse, motorcycles, and eighty sixin' Charlie. The boys couldn't figure what to do when the napalm ran out and it was time to haul ass out the jungle. Until, that is, one of 'em had the bright idea of startin' a motorcycle club. Thinkin' about all the brothers they'd sent home in bags, they called it The Lost.
