It's a shame he didn't realize he was on the wrong side of the road and a tanker was heading right for him. They say one of his ears got found a mile down the big slab. I'm proud to pick up a piece of Dirty Sue on my rubbers when I next go on a run.",
        "translated": "Sue至死仍是一个无法无天的好汉——他酒后驾驶摩托车，一边还对着条子竖中指。只可惜他没发现自己正在逆行，一辆油罐车迎面而来。据说有人在现场一英里外捡到了他的一只耳朵。能在下次跑步的时候踩到一块Dirty Sue可是我的荣幸。",
