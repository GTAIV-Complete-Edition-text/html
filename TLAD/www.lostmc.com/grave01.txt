;0xA6E4BA7E=Harper died doin' what he was best at - cookin' up crank. Having lost an ear in a ice lab explosion back in '03, and not giving a shit about it, Harper prided himself on bein' the best cook of crystal south of the Canadian border. He had the purest shit and he didn't sell to homos - which is rare in this world of hypocrites and sellouts. He was an artisan and a patriot. Whenever I raise a pipe to my lips I'll miss this guy. I hope that ice cools him down in the firey pits of hell. The next time I see this SOB he'll be tweeking with the devil.
