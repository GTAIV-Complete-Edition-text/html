;0x9800CAB6=So, what makes a vacation an eco-vacation? Mostly just clever marketing...

;0x6DC962FA=What could be more environmentally-friendly than driving to the airport in your SUV and flying 10,000 miles to stay in a 5-star jungle retreat with a bunch of other self-important liberals? We have to cut down a few forests, pollute a few rivers, erode a few footpaths and drain the local communities of their limited natural resources but that's a small price to pay for making rich western tourists feel less guilty about the lavish lifestyles they lead for the other 51 weeks of the year. Make sure to leave money for the "Local Sustainability Fund." At the end of the week, the jar is emptied by the bartender and all of the local people get drunk on your money.

;0xBEEDC72B=When we displace the indigenous population from their sacred lands to make way for the construction of eco-resorts where fruity Americans can get massages, we offer them something in return: the gift of gentrification. We teach them about the joys of competition, the harsh realities of a market economy, and the fair balance of a consumer culture that funnels all the revenues back to the First World. What native wouldn't jump at the chance to give up farming and sell ethnic trinkets to stoned Western tourists instead? Nothing restores dignity to a poverty-stricken rural community like turning them into a sideshow for over-privileged gap year students and 30-something professionals in cargo pants.

;0xD7FD6808=Staying in a purpose-built eco-lodge, drinking bottled water and driving around in an air-conditioned jeep really gives people a new perspective on the complex socio-political issues of a country. Instead of simply clutching their wallets to their chests and yelling at the local savages for not speaking English, eco-tourists are encouraged to spend time learning about indigenous cultures and fostering relationships with the natives by enjoying the great deals of 2 for $20 T-shirts that feature cute rain forest creatures on them.

;0x92AD2726=Baggage handlers and corrupt officials will benefit too - by planting drugs into your luggage or surf or bodyboard bag so you unwittingly take all the risk while they make all the money. And if the stoned baggage handler on the other end in Bali forgets to take out the package - you'll get to spend some extra time in an Indonesian prison really getting to know the local way of life.
