;0x387AEE55=Ah, the romanticism of abject poverty. People so poor they have to wear the discarded sports memorabilia of the losing teams in American football championships. Welcome to the Garden of Eden eco-lodge in the heart of Zambia's North-Western province. Garden of Eden was founded in the 1980's by a brave visionary / psychopathic loner who fled the USA in search of a place where he could live his life free from the draconian constraints of clothing, taxation, sex laws and police interference. It's one of the most destitute and remote regions of the country and we have to pump an obscene amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere to get you there but it's all for a good cause: helping the environment. Everything at Garden of Eden has been designed with the socially and environmentally-conscious traveler in mind. Each of the 15 luxury eco-suites is fully-equipped with satellite television, high-speed internet, air conditioning, power shower, mini bar and slaves. We ask guests to limit their time in the whirlpool to 10 minutes per day and, due to some recent issues with pollution from our sanitation facilities, we encourage everyone to defecate directly onto local crops or people wherever possible. At Garden of Eden, we place great emphasis on interaction with the indigenous population. Every evening, local children perform a demeaning dance dressed in the faux-tribal outfits we provided and you can always find desperate ex-farmers huddled outside the gates of the compound hawking souvenirs and babies. Unforgettable photo opportunities guaranteed!
