;0xD7D59B5D=Always wanted to travel the world and show everyone just how much you care? Would some time in the jungle pitying foreign people because they don't have plasma TVs make you feel better about yourself? Caring about the environment means more than just chastising everyone for not recycling - you need to take green vacations, too.

;0x31A1094E=Clamber over ancient burial grounds and visit the gift shop to do your part for the local people. Trample through virgin wildernesses. Splash around in fragile marine ecosystems off of an $8 million yacht. Hack away at a rainforest canopy on a zip line. Gawk at indigenous people while sipping on a soy latte. Eco Elite Vacations provides the very best in exotic vacations that cater to rich liberals looking to offset some white angst in exotic locales.

;0x77A7F8E0=Conventional tourism has become so lower middle class these days. Vacationing in far-flung corners of the Third World is an assertion of your social and financial superiority. Strap on your designer sports sandals and a penis gourd and save the environment by flying halfway around the globe to stay in a luxury eco-lodge for two weeks.
