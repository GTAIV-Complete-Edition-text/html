        "original": "It's not just the greatest marketing ploy ever. \"Responsible Tourism\", \"Bio-tourism\", \"Sustainable Tourism\", \"Low-Impact Tourism\"... there's seemingly no end to the buzzwords dreamt up by marketers and it's all real. IF you really wanted to be responsible, you'd drink your shower water and shit in a bucket. But you're rich and want to see how poor people live, all the while wagging your finger at them for not recycling. A developer razes a section of the rainforest, builds some designer huts, spouts some bullshit about sustainability, hires some local people to look cute and be friendly to the asshole tourists, and bam - Ecotourism. Everyone is happy, especially Mother Earth. Finally, wealthy westerners can kid themselves that they're 'making a difference' while getting shitfaced on local rum and ogling underage dark-skinned girls.",
        "translated": "生态旅行不仅仅是有史以来最大的营销策略。「责任旅行」「有机旅行」「可持续旅行」「低碳旅行」... 营销人员的新词一套接一套，无穷无尽，而且这些新词都是真实的案例。如果你真的想负起责任，那就喝了自己的洗澡水，用桶收集拉出来的屎。可是你很富，想见识下穷人的生活，一边还要指责他们不做垃圾分类。开发商在雨林里平了块地，设计了几栋木屋，雇了几个好看的当地人接待游客——铛铛，这就是生态旅行。大家都很高兴，尤其是地球母亲。最后，富有的西方人可以喝着当地的朗姆酒，朝着未成年的黑皮姑娘抛媚眼，一边告诉自己「我们为地球做出了贡献」。",
