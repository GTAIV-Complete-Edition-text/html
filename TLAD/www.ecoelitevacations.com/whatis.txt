;0xC408F655=It's not just the greatest marketing ploy ever. "Responsible Tourism", "Bio-tourism", "Sustainable Tourism", "Low-Impact Tourism"... there's seemingly no end to the buzzwords dreamt up by marketers and it's all real. IF you really wanted to be responsible, you'd drink your shower water and shit in a bucket. But you're rich and want to see how poor people live, all the while wagging your finger at them for not recycling. A developer razes a section of the rainforest, builds some designer huts, spouts some bullshit about sustainability, hires some local people to look cute and be friendly to the asshole tourists, and bam - Ecotourism. Everyone is happy, especially Mother Earth. Finally, wealthy westerners can kid themselves that they're 'making a difference' while getting shitfaced on local rum and ogling underage dark-skinned girls.
